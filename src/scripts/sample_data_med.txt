"Which means to-day, in a quarter of an hour," he said, as I laid down
the note. "And I fear it's pretty hopeless."

"You know who she is, then?" I remarked.

He nodded gravely and crossed to a corner of the room where a pile of
newspapers was lying on a chair. And as I watched him I wondered, not
for the first time, what had made him take up the profession he had. A
born player of games, wealthy, and distinctly good-looking, he seemed
the last person in the world to become a detective. And yet that was
what he was when one boiled down to hard facts. True, he picked and
chose his cases, and sometimes for months on end he never handled one at
all. But sooner or later some crime would interest him, and then he
would drop everything until he had either solved it or was beaten.

With the official police he was on excellent terms, which was not to be
wondered at in view of the fact that on many occasions he had put them
on the right track. At times some new man was apt to smile
contemptuously at the presumption of an amateur pitting himself against
the official force, but the smile generally faded before long. For there
was no denying that he had a most uncanny _flair_ for picking out the
points that mattered from a mass of irrelevant detail.

"It's bad to prejudge a case," he remarked, coming back with two papers,
"but this looks pretty damaging on the face of it."

He pointed to a paragraph, and I ran my eye down it.

                  "SHOCKING TRAGEDY IN LEICESTERSHIRE

                     BRUTAL MURDER OF YOUNG ARTIST

    "A crime of unparalleled ferocity was committed yesterday in the
    grounds of Mexbury Hall, the home of Mr. John Playfair, who has
    lived there for some years with his ward, Miss Katherine Moody,
    and her companion. Standing amongst the trees, some way from the
    Hall and out of sight of it, there is a summer-house which
    commands a magnificent view over the surrounding country. And it
    was in this summer-house that the tragedy occurred.

    "It appears that for some weeks past Mr. Playfair has allowed a
    young artist named Bernard Power to use it as a studio.
    Yesterday, on returning in the afternoon from a motor trip, Mr.
    Playfair, while taking a stroll in the grounds, happened to pass
    by the summer-house, where he was horrified to see a red stream
    dripping sluggishly down the wooden steps that led to the door.
    He rushed in, to find the unfortunate young man lying dead on
    the floor with his head literally crushed in like a broken
    egg-shell.

    "Touching nothing, he rushed back to the house, where he
    telephoned for the police and a doctor, who arrived post-haste.

    "The doctor stated, after examining the body, that Mr. Power had
    been dead about five hours, which placed the time of the crime
    at ten o'clock that morning. Then, with the help of Inspector
    Savage, who has charge of the case, the body was moved, and
    instantly the weapon with which the deed was done was
    discovered. A huge stone weighing over fourteen pounds was lying
    on the floor, and adhering to it were blood and several hairs
    that obviously had belonged to the dead man. Mr. Playfair
    explained that the stone had originally come from an old heap
    which had been left over when the foundations of the
    summer-house had been laid. This particular one, he went on to
    say, had been used as a weight on the floor to prevent the door
    from banging when the artist wanted it open: he had suggested it
    to him some weeks previously.

    "It is clear that a particularly brutal murder has been
    committed, as any possibility of accident or suicide can be
    ruled out. The murderer must have approached from behind while
    the unfortunate young man was at work on his picture, and bashed
    in his head with one blow.

    "The police are in possession of several clues, and sensational
    developments are expected."

I looked at the date. It was yesterday's paper. Then I looked at the
other paragraph he was indicating.

"These are the sensational developments," said Ronald, "which are
doubtless responsible for Miss Moody's letter."

    "The police have lost no time in following up the clues they
    obtained in the shocking tragedy that occurred the day before
    yesterday at Mexbury Hall. It will be recalled that the body of
    a young artist named Bernard Power was found in the summer-house
    with the head battered in in a fashion which proved conclusively
    that a singularly brutal murder had been committed.

    "Yesterday Inspector Savage arrested a neighbouring landowner,
    Mr. Hubert Daynton, on the charge of being the murderer. It is
    understood that a stick belonging to the accused was found in
    the summer-house; and the butt end of a cigarette of a brand he
    habitually smokes was discovered lying on the floor.

    "The accused protests his complete ignorance of the affair, and
    further developments are awaited hourly. Needless to say, Mr.
    Playfair, in whose grounds the tragedy occurred, is much upset,
    as the dead man was a protégé of his."

I put down the paper and glanced at my companion.

"It certainly seems pretty bad for Mr. Hubert Daynton," I said. "He
seems to have gone out of his way to leave incriminating evidence lying
about."

"Exactly," Standish remarked. "Which may be a point in his favour.
However, there goes the bell. We'll hear what Miss Moody has to say."

The door opened, and his man ushered in a delightfully pretty girl of
about twenty-one or two, who looked from one to the other of us with a
worried expression on her face.

"Sit down, Miss Moody," said Ronald. "And let me introduce a great pal
of mine, Bob Miller. You can say anything you like in front of him."

"I suppose you know what I've come about, Mr. Standish," cried the girl.

"I know what has appeared in the papers," said Ronald, "which summarises
into the fact that Hubert Daynton has been arrested for the murder of an
artist called Bernard Power in the summer-house of your guardian's
place."

"But he never did it, Mr. Standish," she cried, clasping her hands
together.

"So, I gather, he states. At the same time, the police seem to think
otherwise. Now will you be good enough to fill in all the gaps, as far
as you can, which have been left by the papers? And one thing I beg of
you--don't keep anything back. It is absolutely imperative that I should
have all the facts, even if they appear to you to be damaging."

"I will conceal nothing," she said. "You know from the papers that I
live at Mexbury Hall with my guardian, and Hubert Daynton has the
neighbouring house, Gadsby Tower. He was often over with us, and we did
the same thing at his place----"

"Was?" put in Ronald. "Do you imply anything by using the past tense?"

"During recent months matters have become a little strained," she said,
a slightly heightened colour coming into her cheeks. "To be brief, he
wanted to marry me, and my guardian didn't like the idea."

"Why not?" said Ronald bluntly. "Was there any particular reason, or
just general disapproval?"

"I don't know," she answered. "Uncle John--he's not really any relation,
of course--is very old-fashioned in some ways, and has the most absurd
ideas about what girls ought to be told. But one thing is certain: the
moment Hubert made it clear that he wanted to marry me, Uncle John's
manner towards him changed completely."

"One further point, Miss Moody," said Ronald, with a faint smile. "What
were your feelings on the subject?"

"Well," she answered frankly, "I didn't say I would and I didn't say I
wouldn't. He's rather a dear, and I like him immensely, but I can't say
I'm in love with him. In addition, I'm terribly fond of Uncle John, who
has been a sort of mother and father to me, and the fact that he
disapproved did influence me. There was an idea at the back of my mind,
I think, that in time I might get him to change his mind about Hubert,
which would have made a difference."

"I understand perfectly," said Ronald. "And that was the condition of
affairs between you and Hubert Daynton at the time of his arrest?"

"I'm afraid it wasn't," she answered slowly. "Two months ago Bernard
Power came to stay at the village inn. He was an artist, as you know,
and in some way or other he got to know Uncle John. Now, my guardian is
a photographic maniac--it is the one absorbing hobby of his life--and as
Bernard went in for landscape work they seemed to find something in
common. He was continually asking Bernard to dinner; and fitted him up,
as you read in the papers, in the summer-house as a studio."

She paused for a moment, and glanced from Ronald to me.

"The poor man is dead now," she went on, "and if it wasn't for Hubert's
sake, I'd say nothing. But there's no getting away from the fact that
Bernard Power was a nasty bit of work. You both of you look thoroughly
human, and you'll know what I mean when I say he was always pawing one,
touching one's arm or something like that--a thing I loathe. But matters
came to a head three days ago. I happened to be passing the summer-house
when he called out to me to come and have a look at his picture.

"Without thinking, I went in. To do him justice, he was a very clever
painter. And before I knew where I was, he'd seized me in his arms and
was trying to kiss me. I was perfectly furious. I'd never given him the
slightest encouragement. However, after I'd smacked his face as hard as
I could, he let me go. And then I told him a few home truths and left."

Again she paused, and bit her lip.

"I left, Mr. Standish, and, as evil fortune would have it, I ran into
Hubert paying one of his very infrequent visits. He had come over to see
me about a spaniel I wanted. If only it had been an hour later it
wouldn't have mattered; I should have recovered. As it was, he saw, of
course, that I was angry and realising I'd come from the direction of
the summer-house, he jumped at once to the correct conclusion.

"'Has that damned painter been up to his monkey tricks again?' he cried.

"And very foolishly I told him what had happened. He was furious, and
there's no denying that Hubert has a very nasty temper when roused. I
regretted having said anything the moment the words were out of my
mouth, but then it was too late. And it was only with the greatest
difficulty that I prevented him going off then and there to put it
across Bernard Power. I told him that I was quite capable of looking
after myself, and that the matter was over and done with.

"In the middle of our conversation Uncle John joined us. He saw at once
that something was up and asked what had happened. Hubert told him and
he didn't mince his words, which got Uncle John's back up. And finally
the two of them very nearly had a row.

"Uncle John's point of view was that he was the proper person for me to
go to, and that it was no business of Hubert's. Hubert, on the contrary
said it was any decent man's business if some swab of a painter kissed a
girl against her will. And then he made the damning statement that he
personally proposed to interview Mr. Bernard Power the following
morning."

"Did anyone else hear that remark besides you and your guardian?" asked
Ronald.

"No one," she said. "Of that I'm positive."

"Why did he specify the following morning? Why didn't he go right away?"

"He had people coming to lunch, and it was getting late."

"And the following morning was the morning of the murder," said Ronald
thoughtfully. "Now let's hear exactly what Daynton says took place."

"He says that he started from Gadsby Tower at half-past nine and walked
over to the summer-house. He found Bernard Power had not yet arrived, so
he lit a cigarette and waited for him--a cigarette which he admits he
threw on the floor and put out with his shoe.

"Then Bernard Power came in, and apparently Hubert went for him like a
pickpocket. He called him a leprous mess, and a few more things of that
sort, and they had a fearful quarrel, in the course of which Hubert put
his stick up against the wall, because he was afraid he might hit the
other with it, and he was a much smaller man than Hubert. Then he left,
and went back to his own house, which he reached at twenty-past ten."

Ronald Standish nodded thoughtfully.

"Forgetting all about his stick," he remarked. "A very important point,
that."

"He was so excited, Mr. Standish," said the girl. "I know the police
think as you do, but surely it's understandable."

"My dear Miss Moody," he said with a smile, "you quite mistake my
meaning. Now that I've heard your full story I think it tells enormously
in his favour. It is certain that he must have discovered he had left
his stick in the summer-house on his way back to Gadsby Tower. There is
nothing that a man notices quicker. If, then, he had murdered Power he
would at all costs have had to go back to get it. To leave such a
damning piece of evidence lying about was tantamount to putting a noose
round his neck. But what was more natural than that he, rather than
renew the quarrel, should decide to leave it there, and get it some
other time?"

"Then you don't think he did it?" she cried eagerly.

"What I may think," said Ronald guardedly, "is one thing. What we've got
to prove is another. If he didn't do it--who did? The crime, according
to the doctor's evidence, must have been committed very shortly after
Daynton left the summer-house. It is, therefore, I think, a justifiable
assumption that the murderer was near by during the interview, heard the
quarrel, and seized the opportunity of throwing suspicion on somebody
else. So that at any rate one line of exploration must be to find out if
this man Power had an enemy who was so bitter against him that he
wouldn't stick at murder. And from what you tell me of his manners with
you, it would not be surprising if he has gone even further with some
other girl. In which case there may be a man who was not as forbearing
as Daynton."

"Then you'll help Hubert?" she cried.

"Certainly, Miss Moody," he said. "Now that I've heard the details my
opinion is quite different. Bob and I will come down with you this
afternoon. But before we start there are just one or two points I'd like
cleared up. First--what were your movements on the day of the murder?"

"I stayed in the house till lunch; and in the afternoon I played tennis
at a house five miles away."

"You had no communication with Daynton of any sort--over the telephone,
for instance?"

"None."

"And Mr. Playfair--what did he do?"

"He went out on one of his photography expeditions. He started in the
car about half-past eight in the morning and was not back till after
lunch."

"One last point. You have already said that no one could have overheard
the conversation between the three of you on the drive. But did you by
any chance mention it to anybody afterwards?"

"No," she said. "I said nothing about it. And I'm sure Uncle John didn't
either, as he was in the whole afternoon fiddling about with his latest
camera."

"Then it must either have been an unfortunate coincidence for Bernard
Power or----"

He broke off and stared out of the window thoughtfully.

"Come along," he said, rousing himself at length. "Let's go down and
look at this summer-house. I hope your nerves are good, Miss Moody. Bob
generally drives, and never at less than sixty miles an hour."

                                   II

The grounds of Mexbury Hall were extensive, and the summer-house was a
good quarter of a mile from the Hall itself. Trees surrounded it on
three sides, affording admirable cover for anyone who wished to hide.
The fourth was open, and gave a magnificent view over the country to the
south. It was simply built of wood, with a sunblind that could be let
down over the big window.

A policeman was on guard as we approached, and he looked doubtful when
Ronald explained his business.

"Inspector's orders, sir, were that no one was to be allowed in. Still,
I suppose you're different."

"Come in yourself, officer, and you'll see that I'm not going to touch
anything. I take it nothing has been moved except the body?"

"Nothing, sir."

"Were you here yourself when the body was found?"

"I came with the Inspector, sir."

Ronald knelt down by the wooden steps leading to the door, and carefully
examined the ominous red stain. Then, with a shake of his head, he got
up.

"Too late," he said. "Nothing to be got out of that now."

He pushed open the door and stepped inside. Then, according to his
invariable custom, he stood absolutely motionless, with only his eyes
moving from side to side as he absorbed every detail. On the easel stood
the half-finished picture spattered with the dead man's blood. The
overturned chair still lay where it had fallen as the artist had crashed
to the floor.

"Not much doubt about what happened, sir," remarked the constable.
"Never seen a clearer case in all my service. Fair battered to pieces,
he was, poor gentleman."

"What's the meaning of this, Roberts?" said a gruff voice from outside.
"I ordered you to admit no one."

Ronald Standish swung round. A choleric-looking man in uniform was
standing in the doorway.

"Inspector Savage, I take it?" Standish said genially. "I have been
commissioned by Miss Moody to make a few inquiries on behalf of Mr.
Daynton."

He held out his card, and the Inspector grunted.

"I've heard of you, Mr. Standish," he remarked. "And if I was you I'd
wash my hands of it. You'll get no credit out of this case."

"Perhaps not," agreed Ronald. "Still, when a lady asks one to do
something for her it is hard to refuse."

"Kinder in the long run," said the other. "There's no good in raising
false hopes in her mind. You've seen in the newspapers what we've
discovered. What you may not know is that Daynton admits to having had a
furious quarrel with the murdered man at the very time the deed was
done."

"It was that fact, amongst others, my dear Inspector, that caused me to
take up the case. Surely no one out of a lunatic asylum would go out of
his way to damn himself so completely if he had done the murder. His
stick, I admit, he couldn't get over, since he was imbecile enough to
leave it here; the cigarette stump is awkward. But why he should then
add a quarrel which no one had heard is really more than one can
swallow."

He was swinging the door backwards and forwards as he spoke, and I saw
by the glint in his eye that he was hot on something.

"Very clever, Mr. Standish," laughed the Inspector, "but not quite
clever enough. Both Miss Moody and Mr. Playfair knew of his intention.
So how could he deny it? I say, sir, _must_ you go on making that
squeaking noise with the door?"

"Both ways, you notice," said Ronald. "It creaks when it opens and it
creaks when it shuts. Moreover, it shuts of its own accord. Very
interesting."

We stared at him in amazement, but he took no notice, and at last the
Inspector turned to go, with a significant glance at me.

"By the way, Inspector," said Ronald suddenly, "had the dead man got a
brush in his hand?"

"No; but one was lying on the floor beside him."

"Was there any paint on it?"

For a moment the Inspector looked nonplussed.

"I really couldn't tell you at the moment," he said, and Ronald shook
his head.

"My dear fellow," he remarked, "you surprise me. Get hold of it and
examine it. And if there's paint on it, sit down and think things over,
bearing in mind the fact that the door creaks."

"And if there isn't paint on it?" said the other with ponderous sarcasm.

"There will be," answered Ronald quietly.

"Anything else you can suggest?"

"Yes; but I don't think you're likely to do it."

"What's that?"

"Release that unfortunate chap, Daynton."

"Release Daynton?" gasped the other.

"Why not? For I can assure you that he had no more to do with the murder
of Bernard Power than you or I had."

"Then who did do it?"

"I promise you shall know at the first possible moment," said Ronald.

"Well, until I do," grinned the other, "Mr. Daynton remains under lock
and key."

Ronald was silent as we strolled back to the house, and I knew him too
well to interrupt his reverie.

"By the way, Bob," he said suddenly, as we neared the door, "say
nothing--even to Miss Moody--about our thinking Daynton innocent. It
might get round to the servants."

She met us on the drive, and with her was a man of about forty-five, who
we correctly surmised was her guardian, Mr. Playfair.

"Well," she cried, after introducing us, "what luck?"

Ronald shook his head.

"Early days yet, Miss Moody," he said gravely. "I've seen the Inspector,
and I'm bound to confess it doesn't look too good."

"I blame myself very much," said her guardian, "but never in my wildest
imagination did I dream of such a tragedy occurring."

"In what way do you blame yourself, Mr. Playfair?" asked Ronald.

"In going out so early that morning. I ought to have waited here and
been present at the interview. Hubert is such a hot-headed chap."

"But, Uncle John, he didn't do it!" cried the girl.

"My dear," said the other sadly, "I wish I could think so. And let us
hope that Mr. Standish succeeds in proving it. Candidly," he went on as
she left us, "I wish she hadn't been to you. You understand how I mean
it. The case is so painfully clear that I fear even you can do no good.
And the sooner she realises it the better."

"Perhaps so," agreed Ronald. "As you say, it's a pity you went out as
early as you did."

"Well, I wanted to get to Comber Ness by noon, and it's very nearly a
four hours' run. I don't know whether my ward has told you," he went on,
with a faint smile, "but I'm a most enthusiastic photographer. And I
have just acquired a new toy. Are you by any chance interested?"

"Very," said Ronald. "I do a bit that way myself."

"Then come and have a drink, and I will show it to you."

He led the way into the house and we followed him.

"It is a stereoscopic camera," he explained, as he took it off a table
in the hall. "And doubtless you know the principle on which it works.
The two lenses are the same distance apart as one's eyes, and two
negatives are taken at each exposure. Then by making positives and
holding them in one of those machines that you probably remember from
your early youth, the whole thing stands out as in real life."

"And you went over to Comber Ness to get a photograph," said Ronald.

"Exactly," said the other, and then gave a rueful laugh. "And didn't get
it--at least, not what I wanted. I've only just got the machine. In
fact, it was my first load of plates. Now, if you examine it, you will
see a little number at one end of the plate-carrier. Every time you
change a plate after taking a photo the number goes up one, so that you
always know how many plates are left. The numbers range from one to
twelve, and the night before Wilkinson, my butler, who is almost as keen
as I am on it, happened to mention to me that number twelve was showing,
which meant that there was only one more plate left. And I forgot all
about it till I arrived at Comber Ness."

"But one exposure was surely enough?" said Ronald.

"Quite--if I hadn't wanted to take two different views. It is, as you
know, one of the most celebrated beauty spots of England, and I had
promised an American friend of mine two photographs taken from totally
separate points. And I had only one plate. So there was nothing for it
but to use the camera as an ordinary one by covering one lens with a cap
and taking one view on half the plate, and then covering the other lens
and taking the second view on the other half. But, of course, it spoiled
things from a stereoscopic point altogether. However, I'm glad to say
they both came out well. I left them to be developed that day, and they
were sent up this afternoon with the other eleven."

He was examining some of the results as he was speaking, and at that
moment his ward came into the hall.

"Good Heavens! Uncle John," she cried, "this is hardly the time for
photographs."

"Sorry, dear," he said contritely. "The matter came up in the course of
conversation with Mr. Standish. You see, this was the camera I was using
that day at Comber Ness."

She seemed sorry at having spoken so sharply, and laid her hand on his
shoulder.

"It's all right, old 'un," she said. "So that's the new toy, is it? Can
we see the pretty pictures?"

"I've got to make the positives first," he answered. "These are the
negatives."

"Well, it's all beyond me. And I thought they were going to be much
bigger. Each of them seems just the same size as that other camera
takes--the little one."

"Quite right. This camera takes two identical pictures on every plate,
each of which is the same size as the little one."

"And when were these very good views of the grounds here taken?" said
Ronald.

"Let me see. I think I took those the day before I went to Comber Ness."

"A very fine machine," cried Ronald. "They are so clear cut. And these
two separate ones of Comber Ness. Beautiful! Beautiful! I should very
much like prints of those myself, if you would be good enough."

"Certainly," said our host. "Delighted. And now I expect you'd like to
see your rooms."

He led the way upstairs and, having told us the time of dinner, left us.
And shortly after Ronald came sauntering into my room and sat on the
bed.

"What do you make of it, Bob?" he said.

"Nothing at all," I answered. "And though you may be perfectly clear in
your own mind, old lad, that this man Daynton didn't do it, I don't see
that you've got much forrader as to who did."

He made no reply, and was staring out of the window as the butler
knocked to find out if there was anything we wanted.

"I hear you're very keen on photography, Wilkinson," said Ronald
pleasantly.

"In a small way I dabble in it, sir."

"Mr. Playfair was telling me it was a great hobby of yours. What do you
think of that new camera of his?"

"I've only seen it once, sir. He asked me to tell him the number showing
at the end. Twelve it was, I remember. That was the night before the
tragedy, sir. I do hope that you may be able to do something for poor
Mr. Daynton. Such a nice gentleman, sir."

"I hope so, too, Wilkinson. By the way, Mr. Playfair does most of his
developing himself, doesn't he?"

"Invariably, sir," said the butler, looking faintly surprised.

"But he had this last lot developed for him?" persisted Ronald.

"Yes, sir. He apparently lunched at Barminster on the day of the murder,
and left them with a chemist there."

"Thank you, Wilkinson. No--nothing to drink."

The butler left the room, and I stared at him.

"You seem very interested in our host's photography," I said.

"Bob," he remarked, "if you had just bought a new stereoscopic camera
and had motored over a hundred miles for a view, would you suddenly be
so overcome by a promise given to an American friend that you wouldn't
use your new acquisition as such?"

"What in the name of fortune are you driving at?" I cried. "Anyway,
whatever I might or might not do, we have seen what our host did.
There's the proof in the negative. Why, good Lord, man, you can't
suspect him."

"I didn't say I did. I merely asked a question. You see, Bob, one thing
is perfectly clear. A man who was at Comber Ness in the morning and
arrived at Barminster for lunch could not possibly have left here as
late as ten o'clock."

"Very well, then?"

"A perfect alibi. But it would have been an equally good alibi if he had
carried out the same time-table and taken a stereoscopic picture there
instead of two separate views. So again I ask--why those two different
views?"

"It must be the American," I cried.

"Must it? Or is it because he _couldn't_ take a stereoscopic picture?"

"Then he couldn't have taken the other two?"

"Sound logic," he grinned. "Well, time to change, I suppose."

"Look here, Ronald," I almost shouted, "what _do_ you mean?"

The grin departed, and he looked at me gravely.

"It means," he said, "that we are dealing with a particularly dangerous
and unprincipled man, whose only slip up to date is that he did not
expend a pennyworth of oil on the hinges of the summer-house door."

And with that he left the room.

All through the evening his words kept recurring to me, and the more I
thought of them the more amazing did they become. It seemed to me he
must be wrong, and yet Ronald Standish was not in the habit of making a
definite statement without good reason. And when, next morning, he
suddenly announced his intention of returning to London, I was even more
dumbfounded.

The girl was terribly disappointed, and it struck me that his attempts
at consolation were very half-hearted. He seemed to have lost interest
in the case, though he gave her a few perfunctory words of hope.

"I'll be back this evening, Miss Moody," he said, "and perhaps by then I
may have something to report."

But I heard him expressing a different opinion to our host when she was
out of hearing. For some reason he did not want me to go with him, and
so I spent most of the day with her trying to cheer her up. It was a
little difficult, since I manifestly could not allude to the amazing
hints he had dropped the preceding evening. In fact, the more I thought
of them the more fantastic did they seem. If Ronald had a fault it was
that he sometimes seemed to go out of his way to find a complicated
solution to a thing when a simple one fitted the facts. And for the life
of me I could not see wherein lay the difficulty over our host's
explanation of the two different photos on the one plate.

He returned about six, looking weary and dispirited, and my heart sank.

"Waste of time, I fear," he said, as we all met him in the hall. "I'm
afraid it's a case of going back to London for good."

"And throwing up the case?" cried the girl.

"I fear I was to blame, Miss Moody, in speaking too hopefully in my
rooms," he said. "So if you could give orders for our things to be
packed, we'll be getting along. By the way, Mr. Playfair, don't forget
those two photographs you promised me."

"I did them for you to-day," said our host. "I'll see if they are dry."

He left the hall, and for a moment we were alone.

"Got him, Bob," he said, and his eyes were blazing with excitement, "by
an amazing piece of luck."

But he was his apathetic self when Playfair returned with the prints.

"Astoundingly good," he remarked, as he examined them. "How did you
manage to do it, Mr. Playfair?"

"Do what?" cried the other, staring at him.

"Avoid taking the steam-roller which has been standing idle in the
centre of this particular view for the last ten days."

For a moment there was dead silence, and I saw that every atom of colour
had left our host's face.

"I did not go to London to-day," went on Ronald. "I went to Comber Ness,
where I took this photograph. Not fixed yet--but look at it."

He flung it on the table; it was the same as the other. But in the
centre was a steam-roller with a tarpaulin over it.

"You devil!" screamed Playfair, and made a dash for the passage leading
to the back of the house.

"Hold him, Bob!" roared Ronald, and I collared him. He struggled like a
maniac, but I kept him till Ronald came running back with the plate in
his hand.

"He was going to destroy that," he cried. "Well, Mr. Playfair, have you
any explanation as to why that steam-roller is missing from your photo?"
And then with a sudden shout--"Stop him, Bob!"

But it was too late. I felt his body relax in my arms, almost
immediately after his hand came away from his mouth. Then he slithered
to the floor--dead.

                                  III

"I'm blowed if I see how you did it, Mr. Standish."

It was three hours later, and Inspector Savage was gazing at Ronald in
undisguised admiration.

"By starting with a theory diametrically opposed to yours," said Ronald.
"You were convinced Hubert Daynton had done it; I was convinced he
hadn't. Then who had? My first idea was that the murderer was some man
Power had wronged--probably over some woman. He had been hiding near by,
and had taken advantage of the quarrel he heard to do the deed and throw
the suspicion on someone else. Then I suddenly realised the enormous
significance of the fact that the door creaked, and shut of its own
accord.

"Now, Power was sitting at his easel some four yards from the door.
Suppose the door was shut when the murderer entered; it would creak as
he opened it. Suppose it was being kept open by the stone with which the
deed was done; it would creak as it shut, after the stone was picked up.
_In either event it would creak._

"Now, what does anybody do who hears a door creak behind him--especially
if there has just been a quarrel and the creak may mean that the other
person has returned? He looks over his shoulder to see who it is. And if
he sees some enemy of his, some man he has wronged, he does not continue
his job with his back to the new-comer. But Power went on with his
painting. Therefore the person he saw he did not regard as an enemy, but
looked on as a friend. So much of a friend, in fact, that he did not
object to this new arrival walking about behind his back--always an
uncomfortable sensation unless your mind is completely at rest. And at
once a very different complexion was put on the matter.

"Then came my interview with Mr. John Playfair, and the question of the
two separate pictures of different views of Comber Ness on the one
plate--the point that puzzled you so much, Bob. You remember that when I
said it might be because he couldn't take a stereoscopic picture, you
countered by saying that in that case he equally could not have taken
the two separate views. Which was right, up to a point. He couldn't have
_taken_ either, but that doesn't prevent a negative appearing on a
plate.

"The man was a skilled photographer, and he was faced with the necessity
of proving to the world that he had been to Comber Ness. If he could do
so he was safe. But since he had no intention of going anywhere near
Comber Ness, what was he to do? He knew that if you take a negative and
make a positive from it, you can produce a second negative in a dark
room on exactly the same principle as you produce a print. But he had no
stereoscopic picture of Comber Ness; he'd only just bought the machine.
What he had got were two separate views taken with his smaller camera.

"So he makes two positives--you remember Miss Moody told us he was
fiddling about in the dark room all the afternoon before the murder--and
then he takes out his last stereoscopic plate. You see the importance of
its being the last one; that accounted for his having to put them both
on one plate. And that was why he took three unnecessary photos of his
own grounds. On to that last plate he clips the two positives, side by
side, exposes it in his dark room, and returns the plate to the camera.
There is his alibi. He need never go near Comber Ness, and, in fact, he
never did.

"He had Wilkinson's evidence that twelve was the number showing--you
noticed there, Bob, the slight discrepancy between Playfair's statement
and the butler's. He had the chemist's evidence that the plates were
handed over to him to be developed; he had the hotel evidence that he
lunched at Barminster.

"Exactly what he did we shall never know. He drove away at eight-thirty,
and presumably concealed his car in some lane. Then he returned and hid
near the summer-house. He was taking no risk up to date; if he was found
there was no reason why he shouldn't be in his own grounds. And
everything came off. He murdered Power, and drove quietly over to
Barminster, where he lunched."

"But why this cold-blooded murder of a man he apparently liked?" I
asked.

"The usual reason," he answered. "Once or twice after dinner last night
I caught the look in his eyes as they rested on the girl. He was in love
with her himself, which can account for many things. Why he took up
Power at all I can't tell you--possibly at the beginning he had some
idea of choking off Daynton by making him jealous. Then he may have
feared that instead of doing that the artist's attentions to the girl
might have the opposite result and bring Daynton and the girl closer
together. Or perhaps he may have become jealous of Power himself.
Anyway, he saw his opportunity of getting rid of both of them. And but
for the astounding piece of luck of my finding that steam-roller where
it was, he'd have gone darned near doing it. Being a clever man, he
realised at once that his whole alibi had become worse than useless--it
had become a rope round his neck. For what possible reason could there
be, save the true one, for his saying he'd been to Comber Ness when he
hadn't? That was why I was so off-hand to-day. At the first hint of
suspicion he would have destroyed the plate and never given me the
prints, trusting to the chemist's evidence that it had been a view of
Comber Ness."

"Well, I'm sure I'm much obliged to you, Mr. Standish," said the
Inspector. "Mr. Daynton has already been released."

"And doubtless will provide the necessary consolation for Miss Moody,"
said Ronald, with a smile. "For I don't think we need waste one second's
pity on that singularly cold-blooded murderer."

And it wasn't until we were driving into London that he turned to me
thoughtfully.

"I think the lie was justified, Bob, don't you?"

"What lie?" I said.

"That steam-roller only arrived at Comber Ness early this morning."

                         THE MISSING CHAUFFEUR


                                   I

It was on a morning in late September that, happening to drop into
Ronald Standish's rooms, I found a man with him whose face seemed
familiar to me. He was sprawling in one of the easy chairs, smoking a
cigarette, and he glanced up as I apologised for interrupting.

"You're doing nothing of the sort, old boy," said Ronald. "In fact,
you've arrived at a very propitious moment. Do you know the Duke of
Dorset, known to most of the dear old schoolfellows as Catface?
This"--he waved a hand at me--"is Bob Miller."

The Duke grinned cheerfully.

"I was up in Town on business," he said, "and I suddenly remembered that
Ronald sometimes did the sleuth act. So I called round to see him."

"Not much sleuthing about this," laughed Ronald. "Bob--we are rising in
business. We've now become a registry office for servants."

"If somebody would explain," I murmured mildly, "it might be a little
easier."

"Catface has lost his chauffeur," Ronald remarked. "Hence his visit. But
tell Bob the story. I'd like to hear it again."

"It sounds a bit absurd, I must admit," said the Duke, "and there is
probably some quite ordinary explanation. At the same time it's no use
pretending that I'm not worried. My chauffeur has suddenly and
mysteriously disappeared. He's been in our service for years; he was
with my father. And he's vanished into thin air."

"It's this way, Bob," said Ronald. "The man's name is Williams, and he
lives with his wife in a cottage on the estate. By the way, are there
any children?"

"Two," said the Duke. "A boy and a girl--about ten and eight years old."

"Well, it appears that the night before last Williams left his cottage
just after seven o'clock, telling his wife that he was going down to the
'Bat and Ball' to have a pint--the 'Bat and Ball' being the chief pub in
Medchester, which, as you know, is the village close to Catface's hovel.
Apparently it was not an unusual thing for him to do, and Mrs. Williams
thought nothing about it. But, as time went on and nine o'clock came
with no sign of him, she began to get uneasy. So finally she rang up the
'Bat and Ball,' to find to her amazement that he had never been there.
She still wasn't really alarmed. There was another pub to which he
sometimes went. But that wasn't on the telephone, so all she could do
was to wait. And wait she did until eleven o'clock, when she became
genuinely frightened. So she put on a hat and went down into the
village, a matter of ten minutes' walk. At that hour both the pubs were
shut, but she beat up the two owners, only to find that her husband had
not been to either of them that night.

"By this time, of course, she was in a thorough panic. She could only
assume that her husband had been taken ill or had had a fit on the way.
So she got the local constable out of bed, and armed with a lantern the
two of them searched the road the whole way back to her cottage,
without, however, finding any trace of him. And that is as far as we go
at the moment. Her husband did not return during the night. He had not
returned when Catface left for London yesterday after lunch. And such is
the story of the missing chauffeur."

"Possibly he's back by now," I said.

"I told his wife to wire me at the club if he returned," said the Duke.
"You see, the extraordinary thing to my mind is that Williams, of all
men, should act in such a way. It's as if one's butler suddenly stood on
his head in the dining-room."

"Probably suffering from loss of memory," I remarked.

"But in that case surely he'd have been found yesterday!" he cried.

"Not of necessity, by any means," said Ronald. "It doesn't follow that
he's remained in the neighbourhood. He had money. What was there to stop
him wandering about all night, and then taking a train for somewhere?"

"The only station within miles is Croyde Junction," said the Duke. "And
he's as well known there as I am. Naturally I rang them up to ask, and
no sign of him had been seen. I'm worried, old boy, not only because I'm
genuinely attached to the fellow, but also because it's an infernal
nuisance having to get a temporary chauffeur for the Grand Duke's
visit."

He saw my look of bewilderment and explained.

"The Grand Duke Sergius is coming to stay with me next week. In the old
pre-Bolshevik days he was one of the loud noises in Russia, and he was a
great personal friend of my father's. And he has announced his intention
of putting in two or three days with me during his stay in England."

"But do you think there is any connection between your chauffeur's
disappearance and the Grand Duke's visit?" I asked.

He shrugged his shoulders.

"Probably I've got the wind up needlessly," he said, "but the
possibility has occurred to me. He is a leader and mainspring of the
Whites, and I know that his life has been threatened on several
occasions."

"Still, it is difficult to see how abducting your chauffeur is going to
help them to carry out their threat. They can't possibly know whom you
are going to engage in his place. They can't, so to speak, force a man
on you."

"I know all that," he agreed. "I've said it to myself over and over
again. And still I can't get rid of the thought that there may be some
connection."

"Have you taken any steps to get another man?" asked Ronald.

"I told my agent to write about it," he said. "Honestly, old boy, I wish
you'd come down for a few days." He leaned forward in his chair. "It's
possible--perhaps probable--that I'm talking through the back of my
neck. But I _am_ uneasy. If it wasn't for the Grand Duke the thing would
be quite different; I shouldn't have worried you. But I'd never forgive
myself if anything happened while he was staying with me. Why doesn't
Miller come, too? I can give you both some shooting. And I'd feel easier
if you'd cast your eye over things."

"The motive--who can tell?" said Ronald, as we waited for lunch at
Davidson's house. "But it was a devilish clever crime, though not quite
clever enough. Somehow or other Stapleton must have known that Stern and
Yarrow had had a row. Somehow or other he must have known that Stern
left Yarrow a little before half-past two. The photograph which sealed
his fate was probably taken to foster the idea that he and Yarrow were
friends. And he forgot about high tide. If you remember, Davidson, it
was just on the turn two days later at three-thirty. Now it gets about
fifty minutes later every day, so that on the day of the murder high
tide was an hour and forty minutes earlier--at one-fifty. His one slip.
But as to motive..."

He shrugged his shoulders, and at that moment the butler announced Mr.
Briggs.

"Won't keep you a moment, gentlemen," he said, "but there's just one
point you might like to know. I thought no more about it till the trial
to-day. At twenty-past two on the day Mr. Yarrow was murdered, someone
rang Stapleton up at my house."

"Who?" said Ronald.
