lose stuff?
Isn't the "thrash can" on the bootom right? next to the 4 desktop screen selectors.
!bash
For a list of basic commands, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands
!init
Init is how Ubuntu starts up misc. system services at boot time.  To control the services, please install the package "BUM" from "Universe" Repository
you know ... uh .. the terminal here in gnome has tabs, and it has choices to change char emulation instantly. could i do that under xfce, etc etc
loose stuff like that
!Aac
methinks aac is read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for information about aac support
night all!
Yep. I was just about to mention that I_Love_DRM.
how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
guess so; just use gnome-terminal I suppose; I use mrxvt for tabbed xterms
you have a thrashcan there ?
i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
can anyone help me out?
I do too.  it looks like a calculator on my screen, but it's a trash can.
subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)' ?
but i couldnt use gnome-terminal under antyhing but gnome could i
you need to mess with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg I guess
hey folks, newcommer here
why not?
I'm trying to install glibc

alguien que sepa de linux que me ayude
"rpm -U webmin-1.260-1.noarch.rpm" - this command doesnt seem to work for me, any ideas of how to use a. rpm file?
Claudia, hablas ingles?
I need to install it
yes i like the new edubuntu background too - although it's a kinda cold and is missing New Zealand (bug reported) :)

no

ubuntu is debian not redhat
i thought gnome stuff required gnome as the window manager (althouih its prolly bigger than just a window manager today) to run, just as all K-programs (Kdevelop an all) would require KDE ... etc
bimberi, :-)
!rpm
methinks rpm is the Redhat Package Management file. Very similar to Debian's DEB files, but require alien to install. ask me about !alien
hola CLAUDIA
ubuntu uses .debs not .rpms
ooh
hola nelisa
!alien

#ubuntu-es
Is there a way to use .rpms, like renaming it or something?
alien isnt really recommended to use
you can run kde progs without kde (you still need the libs), same for gnome; I run gnome progs like gthumb here without gnome
find a deb
Old, there's "alien", but you should look for a deb first
gracias
how do you add backports to dapper? like so i can get lame debs?
de nada
gnomefreak i cant tbh, this guide is old, and i bet the file isnt on google anymore
I'll look
what is the app?
sabes espaol
aj_, there won't be any backports for Dapper yet - development of the next version hasnt' started yet
ok next question ...  if i compile something and then do make install in order to get it in place.... (in this case irssi) .. and i already had that tool installed via apt-get ... will make be able to "overwrite" my old version, and will the apt-system know that i got a new version of the irc client??

gnomefreak, it's webmin, for administrating your counter-strike servers (game servers)
http://mirrors.redwoodvirtual.com/mirrors/www.webmin.com/download.html
did you enable universe and multiverse
yes
Can i use any of those?
!webmin
See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebminWithoutARootAccount for webmin instructions for Ubuntu. Webmin runs on https://localhost:10000 - As of Ubuntu 6.06, webmin is REMOVED from Ubuntu and will no longer be supported

hehe
Lmao
oops multiverse wan't enabled i thought it was but i did it by hand
AlwaysIcey, there's only a resolution there, that's way to high for my miopia
i can't get vnc server to work properly, again, anyone interested in helping me?
AlwaysIcey, how to get more res enabled?
no
One more second nelisa, I'll look at mine.
coucho, I've dealed with VNC back in my win days
if I get a workable ress I would do better
i'm still in those XD
AlwaysIcey, thanks
nelisa, Try clicking on the arrows next to the resolution.  Tell me if any more options are there.

did you install the mplayer-fonts package?
gnomefreak, read above. Could you help me perhaps?
sybariten, RandolphCarter not sure
nice job btw
AlwaysIcey, Resolution 1280x1024
maybe you're able to help me out?
that should be the path iirc
Is it an older computer nelisa?
ah, the purges begin ;)
gnomefreak, what's the exact path (Im new to ubuntu)
it's a laptop an HP Pavilion N5495
i dont do much with perl except use it in scripts
nelisa, no, i was going to update to Dapper Drake but then when i saw that would have to download 500mb I choose to Cancel
hi olks
/usr/bin/perl
RandolphCarter, how do i do that?
I just installed the 686 optimized kernel for Ubuntu, and now mplayer and xmms don't run. if I launch them from the command line, it just says "segmentation fault". I recompiled mplayer, but it still says the same error. any ideas? I tried googling, and maybe the nvidia X driver is related to this problem (I had a bit of a problem getting X to work with the nvidia driver when I installed the kernel, but it eventually worked)
hallo
cheers gnomefreak
sudo aptitude install mplayer-fonts
RandolphCarter, thanks
I'm not sure then nelisa.  I haven't tried this on a laptop, so I'm not too sure how what resolution options you should have.
nelisa, I did a backup of the sources.list then i replace it with the backup and did a apt-get update
thanks, It's installing now gnomefreak.
hi , im on a live cd how can i partitionate my HDD
what software i need
you need to install the linux-686 package
ubuntu breezy live cd
I did
;p
AlwaysIcey, how do I poll my hardware for more res options?
hmm, so it can't be missing the nvidia kmod :(
whois guenni
oh wait
looks like I didn't. wtf o_O

wooh
anyone here using irssi? please raise a hand
:P np's
and
anyone here know a bit about raid? specifically raid0
would I have to restart? they still segmentation fault
Device Manager.
yup, you'd need to restart
can you see if you can do /set term_char ?
thought so
or at least, restart X
has anyone used automatix?
hmm, probably best to reboot
depends on what you wanna know
alright
brb
yeah
there's some messages about loading restricted modules at startup :) gl
alright, thanks
if I'm not back, all is well
yes you run it or yes you can do /set blabla ?
hello all
need some help
termchar even
:(
coucho, well i have a raid0 array... i made the array with the onboard software (prog that came on the mobo) and i am using it in linux (kubuntu 5.10)
hello can anyone help me????????????
and what's the problem?
coucho, what I would like to do is get another large SATA and just back everything up on it, then use the 2 other sata's for OS's
yes I use it ;)
!helpme
If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
Unknown setting term_char" - what's that supposed to do?
I was just wondering if it's possible to get a new mobo that has more than 2 satas to hook it up so the transfer of 200gb of data to be copied will be faster
i want to configure dns server on the Ubuntu Machine can anyone teach me how can i do it??
if you've got a third drive, maybe raid4?
AlwaysIcey, what I'm looking for??
why wouldn't it be possible?
solve my problems  :)
according to the bitches in my regular swedish chan
WAYTTD?
sybariten doesn't seem to do anything.  This is the first time I've used irssi.  Just trying it out
and sure, you can always get a PCI SATA-2 card and use linux's software mirroring too
coucho, i've only got 2 SATA ports for raid
anyone there?
what does that abbreviation mean ?
it's almost as fast, and you can just put the drives in another machine without it breaking horribly
nelisa, in Device Manager, you'll be looking for the Display Adapter or something similar to that.
i understand, but why would it not be possible for you to get a new mobo that supports raid on more than 2 sata ports?
ok thanks ... hmmm but did you get an error or not? try a termchar that doesnt exist, like /set term_char banana
what are you trying to do?"
RandolphCarter, my "vision" is to get all the data stored on one SATA drive, then enclose it, use it as USB, then use the RAID0 array (2 120 SATAs) to split up and use for OS
i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
coucho, i was wondering if it might destroy the raid array i have now and i would lose all my music and stuff... that wouldn't be good
varunvarde2007, http://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/en_GB/dns.html
can anyone help me out?
ah like that
thanks checking it out in a second
you won't be able to move the drives to a new mobo
super, mega, definitely not
ok
lol
has anyone had problems using automatix?  specifically firefox
and this is the problem with hardware RAID :)
ok, i'm trying to set IRSSI to get the character "emulation" (or whatever you call it) ISO-8859-1 ... aka "western"
sybariten .. nope.  No error.
(unless they're not in a RAID atm)
varunvarde2007, you will also need to read that howto at the bottom its far too much to do in irc
dont use it
ok, then it works for you ... dang
RandolphCarter and coucho, I guess I could just get an enclosure and copy via USB... but 200gb over usb scares me
i would advise you to get the disk, and get norton ghost or something to create an image and put that on your new hd
why not?
no idea about that I'm afraid
!automatix
automatix is, like, totally, unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
^^^ greg_
this is giving me an anurisum
then just undo the array and reinstall everything
wouldn't be so bad, just leave it going overnight, probably take 3-4 hours?
is there a way to check my hard drive. to analyse it for bad sectors etc... it's an external hdd on fat32
coucho, u can do that?
greg_, if you use it, and you break your machine you will reinstall
anyone know how to make a .deb package of firefox 1.5 from source?

i lost firefox
coucho, but that's pretty much a complete backup of it all? how safe is it?
leojstewart, because you don't have your CD in
AlwaysIcey, only video related thing is 82830 CGC
i don't think you have to worry about it, unless you get a crappy image maker
ghost's very safe, just do an integrity check afterwards
exactly
I'm not sure what to tell you then nelisa.  Have you tried in the #ubuntu-laptop room?
leojstewart, it should run fine anyway, though
is there a good one for ubuntu?
Of course the forums go down right before
one that doesn't crash? :)
I make a post.
it does. Thank you. I was just wondering
most of those work outside an OS
ghost does anyway
I wasn't doing it before... I wonder why it is now.
ohhhh
gotcha
tar | bzip is farely safe and doesn't crash :)
AlwaysIcey, they sent me back to #ubuntu
*fairly
RandolphCarter, I've had some problems with tar'ing things
idk why
Nelisa, You need to find a way to make the equivalent of a conference call it would seem.
leojstewart, if you don't want to see that error, you can comment out the line from /etc/apt/sources.lst that checks the CD
i would get ghost, you can boot up and just copy your entire hd array to your new disk
But seriously, I hope you get help.
can i open terminals so they're already set to the folder i want them to be in?
sorry, but I'm a linux-newbie.  Could you tell me exactly how to do this?
ghost only works with ext2/ext3 atm though (don't think it works with reiser)
i would probably allocate that disk first
The only other place I could recommend is maybe the accessibility chat room.  Otherwise, I'll leave it up to someone else here, since I haven't configured Devices manually or used a laptop with Ubuntu.
which fs do you use?
:(
didn't work
still segmentation faults
epositories
erk :/
Hey, I have a little question about getting new hardware working in an existing ubuntu breezy installation, I was hoping someone here could help?
then uncheck the "CD disk with Ubuntu..."
dbcalo , How do you define the ones you want them to be in? Do you want to pick them from nautilus or do you want the terminal to have a different default or something else?
!tell jlunder about ask
then again, I probably should have watched that apt-get more carefully; since it didn't have any dependencies to install, so I think everything in that respect was up to date
when i try and shut down ubuntu on my laptop it just goes blank screen and nothing happens, none of the diagnostic messages "shutting down root file system" or anything, just blank screen, never powers down either.  What do you guys think is wrong?
php5 and gd lib support, what do I have to do to ensure that  php is compiled with GD lib support/?

hi, how can i install LILO from a live cd , i just broke grub and ill install lilo to replace it
:(
anyone got any ideas of how to remove the other modules from webmin ?
man, I can't live without mplayer
http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/grub#restauration doing that doesnt work
eugman, i was hoping i could open them up with nautilus. i remember i used to be able to do such a thing but have since forgotten how to do so.
xmms I don't care much about, unless I want to spam music in IRC
heh
there are plenty of other GRUB tutorials/HOWTOs...
what's the disk info command again?
but still
:/
=== Sir_Squirrel is now known as McScruff
can anyone tell why im able to send in AMSN but im not able to send here in IRC
but i want to use lilo
not grub anymore
how do i make my newly installed ubuntu system to work...i keep getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
it always break
jlunder - what have you got?
every week it breaks
some channels require you to have a registered user name.
i will appreciate a lot the help
you boot every week??
hmm :/ not sure what I can recommend
:(
what's the disk info command again?
amphi, every day
its not here.
worked perfectly. Thank you!
strewth
leojstewart, no problem :)
so, can anyone help me with my problem? after installing the 686 optimized kernel, mplayer and xmms only respond with a "segmentation fault" when I run them from the command line
dbcalo, Well I'm guessing you could do something with nautilus scripts and the cd command. Or copy the folder and then open a terminal and type cd and then paste the location into it but that's no fun.
darwin188,  sounds like you need to reconfigure your X server properly. perhaps install the nvidia or ati drivers. depending on your video card.
i dont know what to do now
i can only boot on a live cd
they don't even give you any other output? :/
Right, so I just put a new CD burner in this machine. It shows up in "Computer" but as a regular CD-ROM, and I can't burn anything through the nautilus interface. Is there some magic I need to invoke to get things working?
nope
but i dont even have a graphical interface
what's the disk info command again?
nintendud@johnspc:~$ mplayer
Segmentation fault
BAM
ok thanks everyone
same with xmms
maybe  iw ill come tomorrow for help
thakns
how do i reconfigure the the xserver?
bye all
which is why I was so confused
;p
!reconfigure
I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Dr_Willis
hello, i'm having a problem...
you could try running it under gdb and see if that gives you any idea
what's the disk info command again?
!fixres
Help to fix the display resolution is available at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
gdb?
how can i manage the services of the system?
I've never heard of that
lol, I was just thinking that
it's the GNU Debugger
what disk info command? df ?
eugman, i'll keep looking into. i know last time i used linux there was a drop down menu it was in if you were looking at the contents a folder.
finally, thanks
libSDL-1.2.so.0" whenever i run quake4 or, im assuming, any other program thats uses SDL.  I have it installed and linked in ld.so.conf and it still does it?
warlock to have full rights like a root user does)
I may have a workaround for you, although it's not a solution.
alright, I ran gdb, now what do I do? ;p
Old, may I ask why?
run mplayer under gdb, and when it crashes, do bt to get a stack trace, and see if you see anything enlightening
!tell Old about root
are you using proprietary nvidia X drivers, BTW? ;)
you need to run 'gdb mplayer'
Old, your first user - the one you created during install - has full sudo privs - you can give any subsequently created users the same
eugman, im installing webmin, and it needs a account to start my gameservers, i dont want to use the root account
i want to give multiple user read/write access to a dir. ive created a symlink to this dir in each of their home dirs. each user belongs to the same group as the dir. and the perms on the dir were set with 'chmod 1660 dir_name'. why doesnt this work?
then type 'run' and wait for a crash
if you mean if I'm using "nvidia" instead of "nv", then yes
I only created 'root' there :-(
(press return too)
helldragon .. I've had problems with grub which I solved by booting a live cd then going into the /bin (? /usr/bin ?) of the hd install and running grub-install from there.  There was more to it than that, but that was the gist.  Does that sound like something to explore for your situation?
Old, no it does not - this is ubuntu
Old, read the webmin page on the Ubuntu wiki
sorry, i'm trying to manage the services of ubuntu, how can i do that?
I need nvidia for dual screens
you can do 'file /usr/bin/mplayer' at the gdb prompt, and then 'run'
ompaul, huh?
Old, read the web page that ubotu sent you as a message
Assistive Technology Support, you can enable the magnifier and a few other options.  If nothing else, that will help until you get a solution.
you do not want a web program to have root priviliges, webmin == evil
disabling root account, I dont want that..
oh
but..
Perkin,  could read up on how the SysV init system works.. if thats what you are refering to.. theres also gui front ends to manage what gets started when.
did it, but uh... weird output o_O
what user should i use then?!
Old, no buts read the web page
that might be what's breaking mplayer and xmms - someone had a similar problem yesterday; you could check if using the nv driver makes the problem go away
k, let me read it
I need dual monitors though!
:(
and, I believe nvidia is necessary for that, right? :P
what's wrong with teh good old command line to start services?
I had no problem with the 386 kernel and nvidia
*shrug* - trying with nv would at least show if that was the cause of the proble,
it's just this one
:/
hello. can anybody help me getting my network / internet working?
er, problem
alright, I'll try it
hold on, editing xorg config

is there anyone in here who can help me with vnc server?
from memory, commands is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands or http://www.linuxcommand.org/
i saw that i can manage the main services, like schedules, with something called gnome-services or similar. do you know that?
Knorrie, im new to ubuntu, mind explaining a little more ?
or should I show you gdb's output first, amphi ?
I always use the root account, I dont dare to disable it
you're on irc without a network connection? :P
Perkin,  im old skool and normally twiddle the rc.d links myself.
?
that is not very wise
how do i make my newly installed ubuntu system to work...i keep getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start

Old, read that web page again, running as root is bad, it opens you to attacks in individual clients and gives too much power to applications that should not be trusted
AlwaysIcey, upping the fonts helped loads
Glad to hear that nelisa :D
question 2, whay are there black borders on the screen?
it says glXChannelRectSyncSGIX ;p
yeah, looks like the same problem - $SMALL_SUM says switching to the nv xorg driver will make this problem go away
Alright ompaul, Like im said. Im new to ubuntu and im trying to run applications as easy as possible, and as smoothly as possible. I'm not much of a googler to look for ways to get around not-using root.
help.ubuntu.com / wiki.ubuntu.com
I'm not sure about that at all.  Maybe someone else can answer it.
but, how will I use dual monitors?
i already tried that not a lot of help
I don't think there is a way to do that under nv
refers to this channel
ok, i'll see in another way
what gameservers are you running.. just curious :)
no idea - perhaps reinstalling the nvidia driver will fix it, dunno; it'd be worth checking that the problem goes away with the nv driver, as I grow weary of saying
alright, I'll check that first
I'll be back
Knorrie, counter-strike servers, I work for alot of companies, and communitys. I know the basic in ubuntu to run game-servers, but im interested im learning more so i can do more with my game-servers.
Old, that page says use sudo, if you want to install something it asks you for your password that is all, no one can brute force your root account that way, I could stay here all night doing one liners, take it as read it is a bad idea, or research it on ww.securityfocus.com
well, brute forcing my password is impossible.
k wait a second
sorry to ask, but why do you complain about a sarcastic sysadmin story, and run games where people shoot each other, i dont get it
Old, if the machine is compromised through the game server you will have only yourself to blame for running it as root, and personally I think you should go and do some research to understand what is wrong with running applicaitons as root
thanks
games where people talk and help each other are too much  like IRC :P
heh
hi people, what is more secure way to set up an subversion server? Inetd or an script that initialize it on booting time?
i want to give multiple user read/write access to a dir. ive created a symlink to this dir in each of their home dirs. each user belongs to the same group as the dir. and the perms on the dir were set with 'chmod 1660 dir_name'. why doesnt this work?
Dr_Willis, can we quote you on that?
what _is_ a subversion server ?
ompaul,  :P sure.. im allready on tht bash.org site a few times
i use subversion and apache2 with the subversion-module
Knorrie, I'm sorry to answer your questiong and you wasting my time litterly when im busy trying to sort out webmin. I have a son playing this game, And this is what i litterly do for a living. If you feel that what I'm doing is wrong, can you please me a work, as i cant seem to find any. Didn't really do good in school.
cvs..
!info subversion
4728 kB
ok ...
no offence
Dont.. please
RandolphCarter and coucho, thanks for the help... btw, if you have a USB hd, you can ghost the image over to the usb from the raid0 array, right?
hm, nothing for a guy who hasnt learned to use cvs yet i guess
Knorrie, man, i will use lighttpd and I know that there is a way to do something like it with lighttpd
that should be the case
sybariten, a software server for moving data and keeping things in sync
as long as it's been allocated
you're welcome btw
Im not having an attitude, but I'm really having it tough finding a work, And i get paid for this. As long as i get paid i do whatever it takes so get money so i can make a living.
that much i know
k... is there any other ghost image creators out there besides norton?
aye, good luck
thanks :)
Old, it's literally...
nope, ghost's proprietary
your blood pressure... ;)
I'm not sure how easy it'd be to ghost onto a USB drive
what he said
hmm... i'll find it somewhere
just got the impression that subversion was the "new and fancier" type of CVS, and hence nothing i should look into
grub show me a smiley now...
in the middle of the screen
=== Tedd is now known as grub
i still cant boot on grub
HellDragon, :)
=== grub is now known as Tedd
tahts weird
sybariten, CVS on steroids if you need more :)
- Sorry, just tired and kinda getting mad at this webmin, as I cant seem to get it to work, I'll brb a second, need to read the page ompaul gave me.
Does anyone know how the install-time hardware detection in Breezy works? Or where I could find out more about it?

coucho, what's the most stable verson? :)
anyone willing to help with an alsa / AC'97 prob
!hardware
hardware is probably https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
tried it already
no go
i think the latest is 8 or something, but i'm not completely sure
hmm, okay, but afaik it relies on the DOS drivers, and I'm yet to see a DOS USB-HDD driver
Knorrie, I will not have people mentioning plesk in this channel I am trying to recover :-)
Hey everyone.  I'm very new to Ubuntu, and just now got it installed on my computer.  I installed it on a 250GB hard drive.  I gave 10GB to /root 20GB to /home and 1GB to /swap (i know thats a lot).  I ran into problems when trying to format the remaining 219 GB as FAT32, so I just left it as free space.  Now I want to format it so that I can share files between Linux and Windows.  What's the best way to create this partition?
2005 is 9.0, so i think 2006 is 10.
aye, what's so bad about ssh?
can anyone help me :(
ompaul, I created a user, and gave it a password. Is that all?
ssh isn't bad, did i say that?
=== subsinker is now known as sub|at|alpopel
219GB is way to big for fat32
cfdisk is pretty easy
nope, kinda agreeing and diss'ing webmin for being pointless
!comfort ompaul
I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Knorrie
Old, that is all there is too it, if you need to run a command in a terminal, sudo command and it asks for your password
true, but i believe that it works after the usb driver has been loaded
:((((((((((((((
Or should i disable the root usage aswell, If so. Is this user account i created -safe- to use for my gameservers and my webserver, so i can administrate them?
+p isn't the limit for fat around 137 gb?
yeah, it should
I have two cdrom drives installed, where can I find what they're known as?
you're a dragon from hell, you shouldn't :(((((((
ompaul, so when i login with putty i will be using my new account i created instead of root in the future?
jonuk wheres your /? /lib /etc ????
i would have to check be sure though
cat /etc/fstab
ide?
try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
ty
There's a -bunch- of hours and work on this server, I wouldn't feel too good if i messed it up by disabling the root account.
ruchbah, sorry i don't konw what you're talking about
root@0[k# grub-install
install_device not specified.
so I can use CDISK to make partitions?
you can always fix it by chrooting in from a livecd
any thoughts on running ubuntu on a T43p Thinkpad?
i'm running a dedicated apache2 install somewhere to server subversion repo's, just because the svn people made a apache-module like http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/libapache2-svn
im on a livecd
cfdisk, yes
 what's the standard size for a FAT32 partition?
Ah, I know. But i have a few things todo on my spare time, and i dont feel like going down to the server just to fix that :-)
maximum size you mean? i don't know, google it:)
Old, if you gave root a password and installed software and let it run as root all bets are off its reinstall time sorry but that is how I view it
1.44 MB ;)
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
maximmum size, yes
HellDragon, what?
the max FAT32 partition size is 2TiB
AlwaysIcey, bunch of unknown devices in dev manager, where to look at first?
ack
you say a 250gb drive, w/ 10gb for /root, 20gb for home and 1gb for swap, with the rest unformated, where's the rest of your instalation?  Whaeres your root partition?  Is this up and running?
how the hell can i reinstall grub
grub-install doesnt work
looking at this deal for a durable high res ubuntu box... http://tinyurl.com/o2lym
can somebody help me with a library location problem im having
let me try to help you
you didn't specify the device
http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/grub#restauration i tried that , didnt work
ompaul, but cant i like..remove the root account, or perhaps disable it from people accessing it?
i see a smiley when i boot
no menu with kernel list and windows
man, that's pricey, my PowerBook was less than that
2 terabytes?  why didn't a 219gb partition work then
how can i specify it
I just installed 3ddesktop - how do i run it?
where you formatting it in Windows?
HellDragon, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/grub gives a few pages that you can try I am off to bed in two minutes
*were
what partition is your ubuntu install /
?
you're on a live cd, can you mount your ubuntu partition somewhere under /mnt ?
i can format it in either linux or windows
is your PB UXGA?
i dont know amphi
Knorrie, i dont know im lost
dont panic
hello
pastebin the output of 'fdisk -l /dev/hda'
how can you dont panic with all the spam
ook
well, windows won't like formatting a large drive, but mkdosfs /dev/*drive**partition* should work
spam?
nothing
fdisk -l /dev/hda says nothing
oh, sudo mkdosfs..
well, how about this
Old, the page tells you how to, however if a program is running as root one of these game servers your talking about then *all bets are off* the risk of a compromise is too high
Old, and with that I am gone, good night.
Knorrie HellDragon -- I've done that for a similar thing.  Had ubuntu on hd and booted dsl.  Mounted.  Ran grub-install.
PB 15 in. UXGA?
12", for Uni lectures ^_^
sata hd?
Oh well, Is there a high risc of people hacking theirselfs into my system?
I'll make a 20GB FAT32 partition, to let me read/write files in either linux or windows.  Then I'll make the rest just NTFS, so I can at least read the files in Linux
he'll need -F 32 to get anything larger than 2GB or so
yes
it'll automagic that
now you say so...
not even people, there are lots of automated botnets that try to do that all the time
ack, no it won't, you need -F 32 :( (my bad)
fdisk -l /dev/sda perhaps
wrar, anyone using ubuntu on a ppc here, preferably a powerbook? If so, does switching virtual terminals with ctrl-alt-fwhatnot work?

okay, running with nv
and uh, still a segmentation fault
http://pastebin.ca/57783 amphi
:(
no segfaulting?
*snarf*
no, there's segfaulting
not that i encourage software piracy *wink wink* but if i were you i'd get hiren's boot cd, which is downloadable via bittorrent
same problem :(
Knorrie, Hmmm.. But if i change the root password to something extremly hard then?
it works on the livecd iirc
bleh
so, now I have no clue what to do
:(

i'll be in ubunti-ppc, this is too busy
you shouldn't allow remote password-based-logins for the root account
ok; do this; 'mkdir mnt'
Sub-process usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)" -- my friend keeps getting this error for gnome-terminal-data
What's up?
ok amphi
never ever ever
is there bit torrent on this?
and then 'mount /dev/sda7 mnt'
jesus christ it's thundering loudly outside
ok
nintendud im guessing u like nintendo lol
woah - wait a second. Could someone take that again? Should i change the root pass to something hard (I'll write it down) to prevent brute forcing(?)
well, it would appear not to be your nvidia driver, so you can have your monitors back ;)
yes, but that's irrelevant to my problem
yeah, but.. now what?
why
ls mnt shows you files and directories ?
yes
that's 'ls mnt'
is there bittorrent on ubuntu?
coucho, what version? 8?
xmms and mplayer error out with a segmentation fault right when i run them. this happened after I installed the optimized 686 kernel.
ok; try 'chroot mnt'
yes, Azureus is good
burps
o ok
mnt is empty now
so, does anyone have any other suggestions?
I really want to get mplayer back :(
Peolple, what is more secure way to set up an svn server? Inetd or standalone process?
pastebin me the output of 'mount'

aww. :(

alright I'll uninstall it and reboot
brb
i believe the newest hiren's boot cd is 7.5, but i could very well be wrong
anyway i can get a 3dfx card working?
coucho, i'll look it up
what does hiren's boot cd do?
as i said, i don't encourage software piracy :P, but it has a number of very useful programs on it
/dev/sda8 ??
coucho - what are the useful programs?  i've not even heard of it.
harware testing tools, partitioning tools, backup tools, things like that
huh amphi ^
gotcha
anyone know where i can find a 32bit libSDL-1.2.so.0 file?
can i have some help?
i dont have any sda8
it's great, it'll really simplify any of that stuff if you have to do it
your fdisk output shows /dev/sda7 as the linux partition, sda8 as linux swap; mount output shows "/dev/sda8 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)"
How might I go about installing SDL on Ubuntu 5.10?
coucho, 8.1 is out, but it has norton ghost on it too :) neat cd
can i burn a uso on ubuntu
yeah huh XD
iso**
look at what you just pastebin'd
mugzie theres plentty of ways to do that
i love it, i take it everywhere with me :P
o ok
cause im downloading something
download k3b

hi, how would Ubuntu react if I have a dialup modem and the Call Waiting service from my phone provider ? would it disconnect me automatically?
wtf
Another question
start again ;) and ask someone who has a sata disk ;)
i feel like a dick
what does that mean
what kind of mobo do you have?
thanx
touch yourself and die
I got the webmin to work atleast, lesser work then I though. And I actually remember everything I just did, that's a good sign of success *laughs* :-)
say what now?
but when i put the other video card in the it keeps saying the x server isnt installed
I'm having problems with install libstdc++5, sudo apt-get install libstdc++5, and I get a problem saying that with in my achives folder permission is denied
that gives me an idea
i dont know what to do amphi
eme?
I have use Wireless Internet, so when I was installing Ubuntu, it couldn't recognize my network settings (since I couldn't plug in).  I know how to go to Network Settings and get my Wireless connection active (obviously), but everytime I reboot I have to reactivate it.  How do I get it to permanently connect each time I boot?
The file /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly.
 wtf is taht
MorbidHunger, you need to run that each time you swap video cards
what kind of mobo do you have?
Could not get lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
Unable to lock the download directory
means grub didn't install; reboot the cd
ill forget all the command
you have some other package manager open?
breeden, do you have Synaptic or something open too?
ill need to do everything over amphi ^
alright
but the one im using now is onbored
i have an s3trio i want to use
ok i reboot
brb
for now rembember your ubuntu / fs is /dev/sda7 - or is sda8? ;)
well, this is a fresh install of ubuntu, and I'm really not a linux user.  But ubuntu's default application add hasn't been of any help
I haven't tried synaptic yet
I don't think its install though
ok, I think I see the problem
thanks
I have a 64bit system but quake4 needs 32 bit libsdl files... where can i get those?
ynaptic
hey whats that program to adjust the brightness of xv
I had synaptic already open, hopefully this should fix the problem
it worked, thanks alot :)
that's why the package managers use the lock, so they don't clobber each other ;)
knoppix? That's bad news...
Hi, I really need to LAN card working on my laptop, but it doesn't tell me the model name. Is there a tool for this?.. Thanks a lot.

AAAAAAAAAAAH lets scream up and down
same problem as ~20 hours ago?
dgl, to my understanding xinetd is not backwards compatible with inetd...  It would require some manual tunning if you were planning on running a server that didn't support xinetd directly, I believe
'when in doubt, run in circles, scream & shout' ;)
lol
grub is dead!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAH!
breeden, ok, so u should use openbsd-inetd?
rofl
how did you trash your mbr?
yes, xserver working but network still down
dgl, if you aren't planning on running any servers or anything like that you probably wont notice the difference, I would go with inetd
openbsd's
does the net work when you boot a live CD?
with partition magic on windows

how can I edit fstab? it's read only :-(
use sudo

right, myspell is the one i was looking for. Thank you

I rebooted into 386 kernel, mplayer and xmms worked, uninstalled the 686 kernel, rebooted, and now segmentation fault again

linuxbomb:thanks ,one more thing ,do you know what the modass dir is all about ?
im getting pissed too
I can't win :(
let's all get pissed :P
MorbidHunger, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
looks like everyone is pissing here at the moment
\o/
does the xerver has to be running?
coucho, apt-get install sendmail
no they're gtting pissed
the package handler will pretty much do the job for you
makelele, no idea , but check out modconf utility
i don't want to install sendmail, i just got rid of it XD
I seriously don't understand what's happening
now, to my problem folks ... does anyone know if i can use adsl and dialup at the same time
yes
and would it conflict with my onbored video?
your ram might be marginal?
mplayer has optimized packages for 386, 686 etc... is the right one installed?
oh, sorry coucho ... right now i'm supposed to have a 512 connection, and i'm connecting at 18 and below ... so i'm a bit distracted ... :/
I compiled it myself, and it worked before.
is there a way to see "extra messages" from xorg? i'm having problems (lockups) and the log files don't show nothing
I have 384 megs of RAM and I'm running XFCE4
this is a retarded question but how do you save an opened vim document via console?
that's ok, i understand, that's very f'ing frustrating
i have 256 sd
everything worked fine before that damned 686 optimized kernel
don't complain @ ubuntu if you compile yourself ;)
xmms doesn't work either
and that wasn't compiled by me
a smoking ati rage lt pro onbored video
:P
I meant is it dodgy - it might be worth trying memtest86
use nano man, much better
no.
:P
I seriously doubt it's a RAM issue
me too, just fumbling for a straw ;)
ESC :wq
like I said, it worked when I booted into the 386 kernel, but once I uninstalled the 686 kernel and rebooted... segmentation fault again
if i reconfigure the x server does it have to be running
I've added a Samba share to my desktop so i can copy files to and from it. Why don't those network connections work when i use the 'browse'  function on websites in Firefox?
but that it worked with the 386 kernel while the 686 one was installed, but not when the 686 was uninstalled makes no sense at all
I know.
probably not, maybe it even needs to not run
i ran it while it was running
so don't muddy the waters ;)
but when i put the s3trio in the server bitches at me and wont run
is it cuz i have onbored video?
it might make more sense if I told you that everytime I booted into a different kernel, X would crash on boot and I had to apt-get install and remove nvidia-glx-dev before it would run, and it would continue to work correctly every time I rebooted until I use a different kernel
er, apt-get remove and install*
a server? video? does a server need a video card?
dont think so
but it wont run
whichj puzzles me
(might have to do with "nvidia TLS links", since whenever I install it it updates the "nvidia TLS links"
)
any idea why hibernate stopped working in Dapper, it just restarts the system now.
arr, this is weird
that's part of the fun of proprietary drivers I believe; just pick a kernel and stick to it, is my advice ;)
what's a s3trio? or is that a really dumb question?
hibernate sounds like suspend to disk... and yeah.. network connections will be lost
well, I still don't know how to fix this. and it's really frustrating me.
i'm not talking network connections
this video card i found laying around at school
i know they get lost
some video card chip
lol k
an antique ;)
heheh
i'm taking about rather than restoring after syuspend, it just restarts
i just cant get it to work with ubuntu
it is very old
cuz i pretty much stopped all my apps that use networking before i hit hibernate
pick a kernel, and reinstall all the nvidia packages I'd guess
my athlon xp died and im stuck on this peece of shit from hell
hmm
why wont the onboard card work?
i would suggest buying a geforce 4 or something, costs nothing and will work
well, I'm only using the 386 kernel now
it does work jsut horrible
i dont have an agp slot on this mobo
...oh..wait...would suspend to disk be dependant on the kernal image you were using?
hello does anyone know a good APACHE-MYSQL-PHP for ubuntu?
MorbidHunger, you need to run the reconfigure command after putting in the new card (sorry if you have, I was awy for a sec)
i've got a mx420 and it works perfectly, and it probably exists as pci card too
this is using swsusp?
if it's meant to be a server... an utp cable is more important than vga :P
umm...i'm hitting hibernate from the log off menu
it's worked before
heh
meh
you dutch btw?
yes
ah
ubuntu doesnt even detect my onbored audio
m2
i dont have a fan or a heatsink either
however, when i was using the wifi earlier, i was using my 386  kernal rather than the 686 because my wifi tends to lock the 686 kernel up
i saw you using paste.ubuntunl ;p
XD
it might be that you need to boot with restore=/dev/foo where /dev/foo is your swap partition, for it to work
um hello
hi
its amazing this thing works
lol
i should send ug uys pics later
heh, well, if it's using disk swap, it's probablty already overwritten the session
lol @ onbored audio
yeah
:D
this is where i make myself look really stupid
ill see if i can get a sound card tomroww
er, s/restore/resume
MorbidHunger, that's a shame because ubuntu worked on all my hardware
you're not stupid
you do that
only thing i can't get running is 3d on my laptop
its cuz im on a compaq and my karma sucks
and yes, a normal boot will obliterate the session
!MorbidHunger++
can someone tell me how to install ubuntu as a dual boot with 2kpro?
On June 29, 1955, the reign of King Haakon VII, who had ruled Norway from the time of its independence in 1905, effectively came to an end when the beloved monarch fell in the royal bathtub at his palace in Oslo. The elderly king lingered on for over two years before succumbing on Setpember 21, 1957, to complications resulting from his fall.
alrighty then, no real big loss
this is horrible guys
it had worked before..i'll ahve to play with it a bit

first install 2k, then install ubuntu
reinstalling nvidia stuff and everything worked
whiskey tango foxtrot?
I don't even have to reboot
my laptop lacks battery, so, if i take it anywhere, i like to sysuspend to disk so i don't have to wait for the boot process
Does anybody else have problems with Gmail-Notify?
yeah, I use swsusp a lot
wish application could you recommend me for partitioning my disk????
thank you amphi. makes me wonder if I could reinstall the 686 kernel and reinstall nvidia things to get it to work. ;p but I am not doing that today
ok but will the s3trio conflict with the onbored video?
the ubuntu installer will overwrite the boot record with a boot-loader, and present w2k and ubuntu choice
thanks for the help and patience
no need to reboot, evar ;)
partition magic
whats the command to display system information
coucho, for linux ?
no
XD
just kidding
sry
yeah, i think my problem was i didn't specify the kernel i suspended with, because i think my ndiswrapper conflicts with 686
Can anyone help me please? I have this error message after.....

coucho, ( WinROFLING face... )
whenever 'repairing' w2k or reinstalling w2k, the windows installer breaks your system
yeah i've already got 2kpro installed i'm just not sure how to go about installing ubuntu. i downloaded the iso, opened it with undisker and burnt the files to a data disc but it's not bootable
Khoacalacan. thats the same shit i got
heh
Dam anyone know how to fix it???
hey, i've like, installed linux, then installed XP, then fixed dual boot
man, i had some fun with the MBR that day
install xp than linux
yeah, it's not rocket surgery ;)
when you burn the iso to a cdrom it should be bootable
Khoacalacan, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=174537 read this at the end
Ok thank you
amphi, dual-booting or my suspend issue
Khoacalacan, there is the solution
that's not very wise
dual booting
i should read that roo
too*
Thank you cocox
i know. I learned my lesson when after resoring my MBR, my XP partition was gone.
Khoacalacan np :)
ouch XD
i was able to get that back by telling CFDisk to repartition
hooray for crappy hardware!!
no, cfdisk fixed it in about 2 seconds
it's been dual-booting ever since
I imagine very Bad Things(TM) will happen if you boot a different kernel than you suspended with and manage to get the session to restore
wow
amphi, yeah, i totally forgot i had done that.
even after opening the iso file first?
didn't think that was possible
cuz i was about ready to throw this out a window earlier
sure it is.
you dont need to open an iso, just burn it byte-by-byte to a cdrom
i had a drive partition completely disappear once
Is it near the bottom of the topic or the whole thing?
doesn't the xp install completely overwrite the mbr?
hey i am making a multimedia cd for windows and i want to make an icon for the launcher to launch    does anyone know how to do this?
amphi, what is the difference between qparted, cfdisk or gparted ??? can anybody please tell me wish one is the best ??
hello all, just wondering if there is a way to test surround sound in ubuntu?
yes, it does
but..if you partition your drives out
then what?
back up the MBR, install windows, then restore the MBR, that CAN work
you're burning in windows?
provided you don't backup before setting your partitions
ok i'll try it but if it desn't work i'll be back to haunt you...
yes
using what tool?
depends for what - one of the parteds if you need to resize some existing partition, otherwise cfdisk for just normally partitioning a disk; there's fdisk and sfdisk as well, but cfdisk is the simplest to use
nero
so first install linux, backup mbr, install xp, replace mbr?
that's one way of doing it IF you want to install linux before windows
nero should allow you to just 'burn cd image'
but make sure you have EVERYTHING partitioned out
or just reinstall grub
yeah
amphi, all those allow me to change mi partiotion size without erase my data ??
yeah i just installed xp first, seemed easier XD
you'll need a live or bootcd either way
i did that some long time ago when i had windows installed :P
yeah it's being awkward
Is solution near the bottom of the topic or the whole thing?
Permission denied" .. there's nothing in the server or client /var/log/messages and the exports allows 192.168.* ... any suggestions of where I could look now?
im so screwed
Khoacalacan, lol just the last post
ok i'll try it anyway, thanks for now
get some decent hardware
oh I was reading the whole thing XD
sorry :P
the parteds are for that as I said; I've succesfully resized an ntfs partition once for someone with a parted; better to back up before messing with partitions generally, IMHO
Falstius, did you check your /etc/fstab?
i need to buy a mobo
i dont have 60 bucks
Khoacalacan, excuse me the one before the last post
student life is hard
yeah
or...wait..is the NFTS drive in your local machine or are you doing it over LAN using Samba?
espically when im busy fixing everyone else stuff

where do you put .sh files?
like, i got samba commands memorized
Anyone know where to put my .sh files?
ahh, I'm the opposite.  Normally I can just do nfs, but I have to look up anything to do with samba.
hey i ahve a cd-wr what should my fstab permissions be?

how's that?
hmm i don't know
one second, dont say anything, I think i found the problem. (Getting late :-(
oh wait, command line interface right?
dunno about webmin, but you might want to specify the absolute path to stop.sh
so don't do that then ;)

darwn188 give me a sec, I'll see if I can help
i'm new to this

and since i don't have a monitor for my servertje i was planning on using vnc for some stuff
so about my shutdown question? any ideas?
at the very least is there a shutdown LOG so i can see if anythign is happening?
figured out my NFS problem, 192.168.* style wildcards aren't working.  Maybe its the VPN running.
hi
this is the stop script amphi, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14421
darwin188 - do you have a file called /etc/XF86config, or some variation on that?
where?
why don't you just make a proper init script for it?
i d like to know if someone knows a way to revert a "rm" command ?
how do you mean ?
darwin188 - sorry /etc/X11/XF86config
is there some sort of xthingy viewer for windows?
is there a kind of trash when we use rm ?
like the ones in /etc/init.d
no undelete on ext3
how do i check taht?
darwin188 - do this .. cd /
Looks like the same amphi ?
no trash
amphi, well, to bad for me
darwin188 -  .. cd /etc/X11
#ubuntu-nl?
yow
darwin188 -  then ls
command not found
yeah ;(
darwin188 -  sorry the dots weren't part of it.  Did you type those?
No such file or directory
ok lets see
the ./stop.sh command works in that dir
no such file or directory, hey but i installed the powerpc version
/home/cs/warservers/speedlink - that dir, the stop.sh works
in what dir?
darwin188 -  you'r on a ppc
yes
darwin188 -  you're on a ppc?
My system often freezes when I exit Azureus
but that's probably not webmin's CWD
does anyone know why?
huh?
root@server:/home/cs/warservers/speedlink# ./start.sh
No screen session found.
A server has been restarted.
thats what i get when i try to ./start.sh
I had a look at this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=161624 but I wasn't sure what to make of it..
Why is WEBMIN no in the ubuntu repos?
not*
yes i am on a ppc
darwin188 -  you out there?
How do I get tar to extract to a certain directory?
jadaz87, it is

i just searched for it
man tar ;)
jadaz87, it's in Universe
amphi, ;)
ping ruchbah_
i have both universe and multiverse enabled
I commend -C to your attention ;)
amphi, any ideas why i get that error? I cant seem to understand it
darwin188 -  ok, there is a ppc channel #ubuntu-ppc (I think)
okey
alright, thank you
jadaz87, you running Breezy or Dapper?
but it shouldnt be different
amphi&
i think
dapper
believe
jadaz87, I read somewhere that webmin has been dropped completely from Dapper
NOO!!! :-(
why?
the error is clear - no script called stop.sh in CWD
can i install the one from breezy?
Hi, does any body knows how to change the totem video output? i install xgl, the videos are really slow, I think I have to change it to gl or gl2...

current working directory
ruchbah_, there is no channel #ubuntu-ppc
darwin188 -  what do you get?
jadaz87, no idea, on either of your questions
Why is it that with the 'Weather Report' that when I click Update, it seems to update, but the 'Last Update' says a time of twenty or so minutes ago?
hmpfh
because the cd command failed
from your paste above
Does anyone know?
leojstewart, the weather only updates once an hour or so - it's from the US Weather Service website
anyone could tell me how to force framebuffer to use a i810 driver instead of the vesa one?
Madpilot - any where else he should check for ppc specific stuff?
Oh, I thought it was from Weather.com
thanks, Madpilot
gonna try something else, one sec
ruchbah_, no - but there are Ubuntu_PPC users here...
ok
is there any way to make it update from a different website which updates more fequently?
console fb?
Madpilot, I;m trying to plug my ipaq
leojstewart, it's an open source app, so probably ;)
darwin188 -- you still out there?
Madpilot, witout any luck
yes
whats up?
yes
i am still here
i'm a linux-newbie... so if it's hard, it's probably not worth it :)

leojstewart, heh
darwin188 -- did you catch that that there is no ppc specific channel?  Did you try the FX86 thing?
whero do I get synce??

you may have to do something special for such a card, not sure, I don't have one
darwin188 -- do you have something that starts with FX86?
=== Evanescent is now known as GhostInTheMachin
oh ok
ill google around a bit more then
thanks amphi
reserve ram for it or summat
same
can you see the ubuntu server in the win machine?
guys why the synce packages are not found??
yes
darwin188 -- command not found?
bitwaut
wait
yeah it
worked
google will know, with any luck ;)
when you download a application from sinaptic , where does it go?
what does it says when you try to access?
it worked
dpkg -L package-name will show what files a package installed
then what?
darwin188 -- do you have something that starts with FX86?
:)
it wats a user and password
sflash, that depends what it is
no
the deb files go in /var/cache/apt/archoves, but packages put files in various locations
How can I access my startup programs... and how can I add a program to startup with the system?
darwin188 -- just a sec
ok... you have to use smbpasswd "user"
ok
does anyone know how to get files within a directory using wget
user is an actual user of the ubuntu server...
?
I have two(2) hard drives and it only shows one hard drive on my computer, How do I make the second one show?
ok, i just want to run this app that i downloaded bittornado. but the icon doesnt exist in my applications menu on top

do i have to add it manually?
Thanks :)
i have tried that but it is not working
np :)
darwin188 -- how about xorg.conf?
how is that? is the only way
probably, some packages don't create menu entries :|  right-click on the Applications Menu and select Edit Menus
What sort of "extention" does a printer driver file usually have?
I am having issues with logging in as ROOT - I have tried the su passwd root and still no go.. I just installed Ubuntu yesterday
hey
if you have an user "zizou" in the ubuntu server
You mean sudo passwd root, right?
you do smbpasswd zizou
yes
is this samba?  if so samba has its own password list - "sudo smbpasswd -a username"
What happened when you tried that?
then when youre accesing the ubuntu server you type the user zizou and the password you asinght it..
let me try bud
darwin188 -- breaker breaker
heh?
i am still here
darwin188 -- how about /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
try with the same password that is in the linux acount
yes
i have it
yes samba...ihave done that
Any extensions other than .ppd for printer driver files?  Anyone?
still holding
it asks for the password and then I type it in. and back to the prompt it goes
darwin188 -- can you post it on http://paste-ubuntu.nl.org?
what shhould i post?
the problem is that i am on my laptop and i am installing linux on another computer
lat2bt
darwin188 -- ok, ok, let me see ....
So it doesn't say "Password updated succesfully"?
nope
someone told me to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but i dont know what to do there
what do i install to get j++ support?
Odd.
hi
amphi you still there ^
thats what I thought.  I have been reading all day on the posts and nothing works after a fresh install
when using smbpasswd it gives all options when  i use the options it says it had to abort
sda8 not mounted
I'm not quite sure what that means.  You could do "sudo grep 'root' /etc/shadow"
darwin188 -- is the linux box on line then?
mount /dev/sda8 doesnt work
The second field is a crypted password.
no its offline
anyone can help me
linux is recently installed and unconfigured to do anything
anyone have any hint for me ? =- what do i install to get j++
It should be a bunch of jibberish (don't post it here), but it might be a "*".
A "*" indicates no password set.
but i get to errors
Helldragon i can try
darwin188 -- what happens when you try that dpkg command?
because sda8 is your swap partition, IIRC from your fdisk -l output - what is the kernel command line in grub?
once I do that command, it goes back to the prompt
=== sub|at|alpopel is now known as sub|off
i get into a blue screen
with options
for selecting drivers, resolutions, keyboards etc
i dont understand amphi
=== sub|off is now known as sub|at|alpopel
but everythging seems to be selected just fine
when i do startx
darwin188 -- ok, that's good.  Get there
Wait, you did "sudo grep 'root' /etc/shadow" and got no output?
i get error of Unable to find a vlaid framebuffer device
okey
linux is trying to mount the wrong partition as / AFAICS
thats correct - nothing
thats weird
how can i fix that
For those of you who know your way around linux, how long did it take for you to get down the basics?
 fdisk -l output says nothing
im using bash
Ok...  Well, do "sudo less /etc/shadow"
darwin188 -- do you have an option in there to not look for a framebuffer dev?
where do i setup enviroment variables ?
nothing goes back to the prompt again
That should allow you to view the contents of the /etc/shadow file (which contains your crypted passwords).
someone told me to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but i dont know i guess
wait i guess
in the grub menu, choose linux, hit e, go to the kernel line, and if it says root=/dev/sda8 try changing it to /dev/sda7
ok
Hmm...something is very, very messed up there.
ill try brb
think a reinstall?
use kernel framebuffer device interfcace
yes or no?
Well...that's probably premature.
darwin188 -- no
breezy is v5.10, right?
im still a newbie at this..and I just installed it last night
then you hit esc and b to boot IIRC - it's been a while
autodetect keyboard
darwin188 -- yeap
er, enter and b
i skipped all the keyboard stuff
hey ubuntu started printing error messages any idea what they are? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14343
darwin188 -- fine
anyone else unable to use google search?
Hmm...I have to go.  Hopefully someone more knowledgable than me can help.  What you're saying should NOT result from a normal install, though, so either you're doing something simple wrong (that I'm just missing) or something was VERY messed up with your install.
now i am on configuring xserver-xorg..select the x.org server modules that should be loaded by default
PORDO, works for me
google works from here
alrighty thanks bud
Good luck.  Sorry to run.
anyone know how to login as root -

i usually just do 'sudo -i'

the webmin
No :P
sh start.sh start
er, I'm not on ubuntu atm ;)
amphi guess what
well, does "sh start.sh start" work for debian/ubuntu? Does it even excist?
i don't know what card it is?  will lspci tell me?
i had to change the first line :O from hd(0,7) to hd(0,6)
and it worked
I think there's where the problem is
didnt touch the root line
hello I need help for install emacs....??
shiity ass dinner
in my ubuntu
you don't need the initial sh if the script is executable
amphi, apt-get remove amule , and apt-get --purge amule doesnt works!!
amphi, what do you mean? what should i write there?
./start.sh start ?
or?
build-essential is not found
that'd help, as (hd0,7) is your swap partition according to fdisk
terry, sudo apt-get install emacs ?
how did you install it?
man apt-get might be worth looking at too, BTW
anyway, you have it working
 i got a problem with XMMS it play my song really slow
wtf
3 mins song takes 10 mins to play
thrice I was try this comand but isn't work
what does it say
amphi, i installed it using apt-get install amule
Hahaha
I tried to do a ./start.sh in putty, it's graphical
errr
or something like that, text based atleast, asking questions and other stuff.
so apt-get remove it
amphi, im looking at the man dpkg an i know how to uninstall but i must have the name of the package
you know the name of the package - it doesn't change after you install it
Leyendo lista de paquetes... Hecho
Creando rbol de dependencias... Hecho
El paquete amule no esta instalado, no se eliminar
0 actualizados, 0 se instalarn, 0 para eliminar y 0 no actualizados.
amphi, i can't remember what is the name of the package...
so it's no longer installed
Where can I get dependancies like glib, sh-utils, file-utils, gawk, textutils and bin/sh?
so, there's this nifty litlte "digital out" 8mm plug on my Audigy2 card, i assume that means i can somehow connect it to my home theatre box -- is it supported by linux?
apt-cache search amule
glibc
amphi but i still have a lot of files about amule.... and i dont know how can i uninstall them
AngryElf,  the digital out can work :P
i use it onmy Audigy2 all the time
may need to twiddle with the sliders/mixer controls.
into a home theatre....so you can get 5.1 from a DVD?
how do i create a screen?
ex, called speedlink ?
xine supports it i assume
cocox porque con el comado apt-get install emacs no lo puedo installar....
!glibc
I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, cr1mson
terry, we need an error to help you
!es
Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
Old,  care to rephrase that.
do you think if i uninstall cpan and reinstall it will have a make file?
hi all
I need to create a 'screen' called speedlink, what is it? screen -R speedlink ?
thank you very much for helping me amphi
Dr_Willis, what kind of wire/connection/converter do you use....and into what input on your stereo?
I'm looking for help with agpgart and a radeon 9600
terry, que mensaje te sale ?
omg........ with every music player my songs are slow
wtf
anyone can help me ?
256AV]  (rev 12)
/dev/sda1
yw - it's strange that grub was so misguided - did you move partitions around or something?
wha tis that?
Dr_Willis, I need to create a 'screen' called speedlink, what is it? screen -R speedlink ?
i just resized a partition with the evil partition magic
Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
terry, ok, are you using apt-get or synaptic or anything else?
aahhhhh i want my normal sound back
;(
Old,  using screen you can rename the screen sessions. check the screen tutorials.. or you can always edit your .screenrc file and have it create one every time
now I use both
its weird
damn it
Dr_Willis, i want to create a new one called speedlink? I get a error when starting my game-server with webadmin, the error is:Output from command .. No screen session found.
terry, apt-cache search emacs | grep emacs
I guess I have to start a screen called speedlink
but didn't work
a ok
terry, you can only use one at a time
Old,  you sure its not saying you need to have screen running?
Exactly, I think i need a screen running, but how do i run one ?
Old,  it MAY be refering to the 'screen' command.
oh, yes, I'd forgotten that you'd sinned ;)
I need help with my mouse. It sometimes randomly moves around my screen, locks the y-axis and only moves along the x-axis and will randomly click while it moves. Any help?
or it may be using 'screen session in' a rather vague way.
im getting crazy
damn sound
All finished, now what?
everything plays at 0.5 speed
Reboot?
damnit
it's trying to calm you down ;)
what happened to my sound
even the sound in my games is slow
what happened
No -- sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Okay
Dr_Willis, yes? that's what im talking about i guess?
I've got a question about choosing which build of Ubuntu to install. I've got a Athlon 64 processor, but am I correct in understanding Automatix will not work with that build?
Old,  run 'screen' then in a terminal - i guess
Okay it works this time.
how can I open the emacs....???
what happened to my sound !!! nooooooooooooo
it wants you to start a command in screen with a particular session name?
exactly
Find where it says `Identifier "Generic Video Card"'
screen -S foo will do that
amphi,  somthing seems - odd about that. do ya think?
And below that line should be a Driver "nv", which you should replace the "nv" with "nvidia" (unless it's already done)
Any mouse help?
amphi, what's dmS ?
-dmS
!pastebin
the whole thing seems odd
http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
args to screen - man screen for more ;)
-d means run detached from a tty
nickpresta -- how newbie are you?
It's "nv".
k
Change it to "nvidia"
how to kill all procces including "speedlink" init ?
Then hit Control+O and Enter
I'm familiar with *nix like systems but I haven't had this problem before or the inner workins of X so I don't know how to fix it/diagnose it.
nickpresta -- do you know how to look at /etc/X11/Xorg.conf ?
yeah
It looks fine to me
Okay, done.
'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start', then you should be at the login screen. At which point you type your username and password.
nickpresta -- take a look see what your mouse driver is listed at there
amphi, how do i kill all procces having "speedlink" in their name ?
Okay!
'pgrep speedlink' will show what pids match speedlink
IMHO, a sane way to do this is to have the script start the server and write the PID to a pidfile in, say, /var/run, and then the stop script will just kill [-9]  `cat /var/run/$PIDFILE`
gave me nada..
'pkill speedlink' should kill them all im not so used to it but i belive it will.
nickpresta -- it will be near the top under Section "InputDevice"
didnt work
I have a few "screen -R speedlink" running
can anyone help me with ndiswrapper... I have a WG311v3 by NETGEAR, i cannot get this to work... My card is on the compatablity list, but it doesn't appear to work, can anyone please tell me how to get this working? is it even compatable?
Okay, I'm just logged in.
Okay, so now you're inside GNOME?
If you're on GNOME now, right click on your desktop then click "Create Launcher"

Let me log XChat on my computer now.
Okay
nobody can help me
:(
i tried to reboot, dont work
http://pastebin.com/730405
Okay, I'm on GNOME.
You installed X-Chat?
:S
Finally on my computer.
Okay cool.
I accidendly deleted some things from the notification area (Speaker icon etc) how do I get them back?
It was already there.
sudo apt-get install gtkpod exfalso
Okay.
If someone can help me with this, I will love you forever. It's not much, but it has promise =)
Separately?
Just that entire command
Run it from gnome-terminal
I did that and it didn't find it.
Oh.. hmm
im getting crazy
damn sound
I ran GTKPOD only.
I've got a question about choosing which build of Ubuntu to install. I've got a Athlon 64 processor, but am I correct in understanding Automatix will not work with that build?
'sudo apt-get install gtkpod' -- Doesn't work?
HellDragon, you cant reboot?
you'd sacrifice cpu power just to use automatrix?
!automatrix
Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, thrice`
No, "gtkpod exfalso" together didn't work.
I'm a complete beginer, so yes if that's what it takes to make it look beter, I'd cosider it.
Now "sudo apt-get install exfalso" is not working for me.
sudo apt-get install gtkpod
That is done.
Connect your iPod.
It is connected.
I can't even seem to get it to recognise my resolution can go above 1024.
"E Couldn't find package exfalso"
Forget about exfalso for now.
Hi Guys -    I accidendly deleted some things from the notification area (Speaker icon etc) how do I get them back?
Okay.
gtkpod
Okay.
Then see if you can read from your iPod.
Yes, that works.
So all your music is there?
Let me check.
Yes, it's all there.
=)
anyone with any wine experience?
Hashed 400/400.
Time to remove the horrible songs :P
anyone know why my /dev/dsp is permanently 'busy' even though alsa is supposed to be mixing and emulating oss?
Right click on your taskbar and click "Add Applet/Application to Panel"
What horrible songs?
Hi Mau
Any idea of how much cpu power I would be sacrificing for asthetics?
Placebo.... :P
=== mheath[laptop] _ is now known as mheath[laptop] 
Screw you

hi there
right click the panel, add to panel
Now, why the hell won't exfalso work??
Now, why the hell won't exfalso work??
What else to download and install?
damn... hoary is old ;)
is your user part of the "audio" group?
yup
It says there's no installation candidate for exfalso?
Is it a wine problem that you have, or should you just set your entire desktop to 640x480 before activating wine?
you're sure /dev/dsp permissions are correct?
Kuja, No, but Azureus says that :/
+rw for group audio
yeah - i made a server setup with apache2 using a falsh drive to show people
Setting up Java is a bit more complicated.
what if you just chmod 777 /dev/dsp?
Couldnt' find package exfalso"
I see.
yeah - i made a server setup with apache2 using a falsh drive to show people
nope.. its busy not permission problems
you perhaps need to use the alsa dmix plugin
ok ok, i believe you... i don't know hte answer though :\
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
Okay.
amphi , am doing, doesnt do it for me yet somehow
are you a tech?
in my professional career, yes
however, i administer windows servers on a day to day basis :\  linux is for fun
Are there any commented lines that you missed and should be uncommented?
lol... unprofessional answer
For some reason I can't get mod_userdir to work w/ dapper's apache2 package
yeah linux is for gurus
I tried dmix, it seemed to work, but I like my box to only make one noise at a time  ;)
All "deb http:/" and "deb-src" are uncommented.
not exactly true... by any sense of the word guru
I've installed a few debian machines as simpel samba servers, but that's the extent
Ubuntu is as close to perfect as could be for ANY OS
do you like windows server better than linux
I need install tomcat on dapper. where I find good howto?
then you can peacefully liberate their machines when they have to upgrade for vista ;)
i haven't found a good exchange replacement yet, but I wouldn't say I "like" windows ;)
i was just able to enable ati drivers after trying for days yay !
can u get rhapsity on here
wims, great
later dudes
persistance pays off
i would love to... ubuntu is soooooooo close... dapper is amazing
Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.load should be loading up mod_userdir, but everything i can see tells me its not working
but ubuntu kinda limited since its linux
bur[n] er, yes it is and the installer on the live disk rocks
or maybe i just cant do what i want
one little thing, i'm using dual head, but i can't move one program from one screen to the other, i have to keep the window on the screen i started it on, does anybody know how i can change it so that it's basically one big desktop?
limited?
lol... I just put together this simle script with some folders with pages and data on a flash drive to set up apache2 on LiveCD to introduce some peole to linux
hoaryLiveCD, cool
i have yet to get espresso to get passed disk partitioning, but it looks promising
how would i make a live cd
er... s/espresso/ubiquity
lol... yeah
i would like to test linux on my desktop
bur[n] er, if you tried LVM, then that requires a reboot after starting it..
then it will install properly
i have it on my old old old laptop so its veryslow
lol... yeah
ISTR reading about something called openexchange, dunno how much of a dropin replacement it is
openxchange doesn't quite cut it and it's far from free
are you a tech?
we had that issue yesterday at our LUG meeting where satempler installed Ubuntu dapper F7 over his Kubuntu
Check the private message I sent you.
ah, double damn
hoaryLiveCD, Network admin yea
do you like linux better than win32
can someone help me i wanna get rhapsity on here is it possible?
if I had clients who needed web servers, there would be no contest... lamp hands down
hoaryLiveCD, yes by all means
you could try using "wine" or crossover office
No such file or directory
yeah! great!
I run Linux everywhere
burner whats wine??
also try writing to Real and getting support... they should support you if you're a customer
crossover office isnt free though
Even his Toilet Runs Linux!
!wine
running Ubuntu suse and slax here
wine runs w32 apps
wine lets you run windows executables on linux
Slax Live Cd's are dang nifty.
for real
yup
with varied success rates
wow
Dr_Willis, ya and MySLax is even cooler
do you recommend http://www.onlamp.com/
i didnt know that
!wine
theres cedega which has directx apis
but can someone help me here
sure do hoaryLiveCD
how can i get wine?
No such file or directory
www.winehq.org
lol... great
and thats it then install?
yup
meh
shit happens
"wine blah.exe"
I run apache here for my Ampache tunes server
lmao
!tell mugzie about wine
stupid ati control panel in linux
has anyone been sucessful with adding music files from over the network to a media library?
via samba? yes
bur[n] er, how do you do it?
drag n drop ;)
unless hes on a mac!!
which wouldnt make sense if he was in #ubuntu
bur[n] er, yeah, but will that acutally add it to the library.. like in rythmbox?
to download tunes
open nautilus... ctrl+L... smb://computerwithsharedfiles/music... drag and drop into rhythmbox or something that supports gnomevfs
you can also do a samba mount
but wine has cannot work on some programs?
it works with most
bur[n] er, will you send that again?? lol somehow it just dissappeared?
lets say i wanted to run like albleton live or fl studios will it run that?
most likeley
open nautilus... ctrl+L... smb://computerwithsharedfiles/music... drag and drop into rhythmbox or something that supports gnomevfs
you can also do a samba mount
/usr/X11R6/bin/
http://www.transgaming.com/
that runs everything
sorry about the /usr/X11R6/bin/
bur[n] er, yeah, i tried to just right clik on the share and mount it, but rythmbox couldnt see the mount
ok
hoaryLiveCD, to play them actually... very cool package
where chances are you didn't mount it correctly.... if it's mounted, any app should work.  amarok, rhythmbox, listen, quodlibet, beep-media-player, xmms, etc.
How do i kill all proccess having speedlink in them ?
bur[n] er, thanks
any one knows a repositorie where i can find the w32codecs?
sounds vert cool... can i get a looks see
for the 6.06 version
I sent so many PMs!
!tell _pm about RestrictedFormats
How do i kill all proccess having speedlink in them ?
You're not registered.
 http://mplayerhq.hu download link has some codecs
ps aux | grep speedlink and kill 'em individually; they're all screen processes, no?
that was is so hard compared to the wiki link
anyone know where i can get libfglrx_pp.so.1
yeah, they're screen processes
Well, exfalso package not found yet :/
did you follow the wiki about the ati binary drivers?
Is there a way to kill them auto? :)
!tell MorbidHunger about ati
Just installed Amarok.
"/ns register password", where "password" is your password.
there is the mplayer in some repositorie?
you can kill all the screen processes...
check your messages
root 17799 0.0 0.0 4192 1648 ? Ss 03:04 0:00 SCREEN -R speedlink
root 17949 0.0 0.0 3924 996 pts/0 S+ 03:11 0:00 screen -S speedlink

what it says
Okay.
that's what it says (Sorry for copy/past)
thats scary
i read it, but i must play a wmv video
When i kill one it gets back again i think
can i install rpms?
i can play wmvs... did you try totem-xine _pm?
yes, via alien
let me try it
but it's desirable to find a deb instead of an rpm
try System Monitor and Kill first one
hoaryLiveCD, system monitor?
or just "killall screen"
No i run other screen commands aswell
meh
ill jsut run apt-get
Says, "The nickname [Taru]  is already registered."
System Monitor
can I use blackdown's JDK instead of Sun JDK for tomcat?
I dont run graphical ubuntu, I run ubuntu server.
Haha sucker.
?
you can use "ps ax" and "kill (PID#)"
Anyways, you made the changes I told you to, right?
Yes.
or killall speedlink
sudo apt-get update
if i install the beta version, how can i update it when the final version comes out? a apt-get upgrade will do the updatE?
I did.
Doing it again lol.
"Done"
Taru, when typing someones name, ex, if he is named "kuja" type, ku then press *tab*, the nick will pop-up
Now try installing exfalso again.
Okay, thanks ^^
I cannot use sun-j2sdk for dapper. which repository use???
np Taru
I typed "Ku" and pressed *tab* and nothing; ;
hmmm, there seems like there's no wine package for 64 breezy in the wine repository, does that mean i have to get the source and build it myself?
what client?
exactly, what mirc client are you using... ?
XChat
Because my nickname is in lowercase.
It doesn't start with 'K', it starts with 'k'
Oh!
xchat does tab completion I believe
kuja, There!
;)
:)
lol
irssi'll deal with case errors
amphi, Thanks^^
He's new, better not introduce him to ncurses madness.
lol
amphi, I see^^
"ncurses's austere beauty", shurely ;)
I give up with webmin
5hours, waste of time.
just use ssh ;)
I cant, it's annoying :((
Couldn't find package exfalso"
Hm...
I want to give my users access trough a page, so they can start/close their server
Um, is exfalso only in the Dapper repositories? Anyone know?
ah...
easy login, or whatever. 1 account, whatever. I just need it..
is it possible to install the system (dapper flight4) permanently WITHOUT using the espresso  installer?
amphi, you got any clues of how todo an alias? ex ./speedlink would do screen ./hlds_run -game cstrike +maxplayers 12 -port 27031 +map de_dust2 % ?
why not just have the server start at boot time?
amphi
woot, good idea
how todo that? :D
goodmorning
write an init script for it, stick it in /etc/init.d and use update-rc.d to make the runlevel symlinks
anyone know how to turn off how windows redraw while you move them?
you could use an existing script as a skeleton, and modify it
Not sure what's wrong with exfalso
I know in openbox ;)
amphi, where is it ?
where is what?
amphi, hey its jhenn
nevermind, how would a init.d script look like ?
kuja, :/
I suspected as much ;)
look at some of the ones in /etc/init.d
can i use cd /home/blabla and underneeth it start the server ?
why do you need to do that?
amphi, how would it else know where to start the server?
what do you mean, where? Where the binary is?
./hlds_run -game cstrike +maxplayers 12 -port 27031 +map de_dust2 %
I dont even know how a init.d script looks like, I looked at it , but i dont know how it works out. Should "PATH=" be init aswell?
Could you perhaps give me an example on pastebin amphi ?
you can specify absolute paths
I'll write one, one second
and show you how i did it
!pastebin
http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
yo how do i know whats my user name
Hi... does any body running xgl?
amphi, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14425 - would this work?
whoami
type that at a terminal
ok
your bur[n] er
I have no idea, I know nothing about that server
for instance, what is the +map arg? does that need to point at some data file?
amphi, it's a game-server, I just need to know if that looks correctly (dont bother about the ./hlds_run path)
test
omg im still on!??
amph, no no, dont bother about the ./hlds_run line, it's correct
n e 1 c this?
mr_foamfingermak, no
mr_foamfingermak, we dont see it, type something..
why are you using screen?
what should i use? Im new to ubuntu
I feel so pathethic sometimes...
sudo apt-get install gaim
screen is a useful tool
why would you run a server in screen?
when i type in codes like this one
what should i use iyho ?
 wine "/home/USERNAME/.wine/c/Program Files/Windows Media Player/mplayer2.exe" it says file not found
does it spew messages to the console while it's running?
so you dont have to leave the terminal open.
yes
but for some reason i dont see internet explorer or anything
how do i run a deb
if i close putty without screen, = the server dies.
daemons normally run detached from a terminal
i run game servers in screen all the time.
but most game servers hang on to the terminal
oh, ok, perhaps you can help Old
I reckognize you from somewhere Tidus?
kuja, Okay.
kuja, I had to make rice.
dunno...
like we said, it doesnt work for everything
maybe #boinc?
Tidus, where do you work at, do you use qnet?
what is the command to make swap space?
perhaps an old staff member?
kuja, I would leave it out for 1 hour... but someone is coming so I just cook it now.
sorry, not any of those.
lol
Ah ok
mkswap ;) there weg o
we go*
kuja, It's going to be hard rice :/
Heh
You suck at rice :P
Tidus, can you help me out , can we join a private channel and talk? As im not authed, and my eyes are starting to hurt becuase of the text in the channel
how do i run a deb
kuja, Well after seeing how you guys do it, I know now.
=P
kuja, But no time atm ; ;
#chat-bla Tidus, if you can, highly appricaited.
dpkg -i  foo.deb to install
/join #chat1
hello
kuja, Soft rice is much better because you can just keep eating it, hard rice can get full off of ; ;
kuja, Rather unpleasant at that!
You and your silly Filipino cooking style.
not true!
lol
Hard rice sucks :P
Try soft rice ; ;
I know ; ;
I just tried to put away 5 cups of the stuff
lol
DIDN'T HAPPEN!

when using wine do u have to like always have it open or how do u install programs?
=== blanky is now known as blank_
 you have to have win open while running programs?
s/win/wine/
I think most wine users get confused about it or how it works.
doesn't wine work on 64 bit ubuntu ?
you have to use the "wine" program to preface the install command I think
and on some distros it "associates" with wine automagically
but I have no clue, I don't use Wien
wine even
so letssay i wanna install windows media player 9 how would i do that
hey, my second HD on my new install of UBUNTU seems to be mounted as Root, making it so that I effectively cant use it for anything, I can make folders in it, but not any other files, any ideas on how to fix?
how do i force the intall of a .deb
Install VLC :P
not wise
true
i dont have chkconfig installed by default.. whats the equivalent in ubuntu?
anyway to tweak which daemons i want to enable.. etc.
um naw i just wanted windows 11 i just used 9 as a example
kuja, Gaim was already installed to the newest version.
Okay cool.
kuja, I want exfalso!
You can run it if you want to get on MSN.
sysvconf?
MorbidHunger, dpkg --force-help
or something like that
dont hqave that either.. hmm
you have to install it :P
so i just install a program regularly with wine
?
overwriting possible-customised configuration file"?
why do you want to force it?
=== Compuqiz is now known as Compuwiz
mugzie, first off, you can't install EVERYTHING with wine
mugzie, it has to be supported.
yea i understand that
i cant seem to get the ati control panel working. so i got the file that it said it needed and it wont install
hmmm is paltalk supported
?
mugzie, go to the wine website for a list of supported programs.
if it's a first install, you can ignore that IMHO
brb
whats the wine website again hehe
the power of google is awesome.
www.winehq.com
thanks
heh.
any ideas on how to make my second HD accessible to all users?
yeah it is the first install
any ideas on how to make my second HD accessible to me?
but now I'm stuck at a command prompt and I dont know how to continue
MorbidHunger, if it won't install, forcing it will not make it work.
it says it cant overrite some file
where the supported programz list located at?
perhaps permissions are bad? And make sure you *want* it to overwrite that file. (whatever it may be)
meh
so I need to change the permissions of that one file?
is there a package for gimp 2.3?
anyone running ubuntu on a laptop?
Compuwiz, that was my reply for MorbidHunger not you
oh, haha. my bad
!tell T` about ask
i'm curious if you guys do any harddisk power management
I use hdparm to spin down the disk here
ok the program is ok paltalk is supported so do i just install regular o how would i do that?
amphi, manually?
amphi, or you run the daemon?
i see soemthing in /etc/init.d
no, an acpi script sets the timeout
amphi, umm i c.. where can i find that? think you can help me set that up please?
=== thev is now known as theverant
mugzie, looks like you need to read about using wine. Please do so.
look at the scripts under /etc/acpi
Why is that I cannot connect to my hotmail through konqueror? I give the right passw but it don't access my account? I think it is about certificate, but i do not know how to set up them.
amphi, i got a bunch of them
there may well be a gui tool in gnome for this; I wrote my scripts myself
kuja, To move all my songs to my harddrive from i-pod, do I extract them from database?

kuja, Okay.
or perhaps acpi events
is there a way to edit the gnome keychain
pm?

hi all
New user here, I'm running this from a cd, is there any way to get to my hard drive?
Quartlow, yes, get the install cd, and then run the installer
bah, you're not identified to services
oops.. sec
anyony here can help me on how can i repair my grub?
amphi, actually i am
h3h_timo, so it can't be done from the live cd then?
-NickServ- You have already identified
Quartlow, not to my knowledge
Cool, thanks for the quick answer. h3h. I snooped around and couldn't figure it out.
how do I get my cups client to show printers that are broadcast/shared on the network ?
Quartlow, there should be an icon from your desktop... double click on that and it should run esspresso installer....unless you have an older version of ubuntu, but i know dapper has it... does breezy too
kuja, It is saying that the songs did not match file type and so it will not export all my songs...
Quartlow, maybe ^^ that works
lol
Wonder what happened to my songs on my i-pod.
Err, figure it out later.

I think I need to try and sleep a little bit now
Laser the only one on the dektop is one for the cdrom.
Peace Kuja!
how can i repair my grub? i can boot to my ubuntu when i installed windows.. anyone can help me?
Quartlow what version of the Ubuntu live CD do you have
Just leave your computer on.
kuja, lol
can I create a new partition in my empty space on the same drive that my running ubuntu is on?
Good question, I just downloaded the iso yesterday and this only the second time i've used it. Kind of test driving
2.21
how can i repair my grub? i can boot to my ubuntu when i installed windows.. anyone can help me?
 It should definitely be possible to access your hard drive from the live CD.  It's also very likely to be read-only access.  How easy it'll be to set up is another question
how do you open the gnome keychain?

Anyone know why I cannot apt-get frostwire or exfalso?
!exfalso
Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
Couldn't find package frostwire"
what is exfalso
exfalso yes please!
Managu, read only would be fine. I just wanted access to my bookmarks, some jpg and mp3 files.
I just want to get more familar with it before I go trying to install it
exfalso is a program that allows you to organize song tabs and stuff.
ladies and gents, good evening
I have a little question
h3h_timo, Like make all your songs look neat and in good order in your computer and i-pod.
why is it that my at jobs seem to hang when they were issued by my normal user, while it all works wonderfully well when issued by root?
I don't know offhand how to find the partition using the gui.  From the command line, you can "sudo fdisk -l" (careful, dangerous command if mistyped! that's a lowercase L) to find the partition name of your windows drive.  If you've got nothing special installed and only 1 hard drive, it's probably /dev/hda1 (first partition on primary master drive).
I DID something weird tonight...
it's kinda driving me nuts, my username isn't listen in /etc/at.deny, but my at jobs seem to run forever without actually doing anything
i was sitting in an caf in san francisco, typing esperanto in a jabber conference room on my nokia 770 over a wi-fi connection.

i've got a ipod problem. i'm using 5.10 and installed banshee and gtkpod but my computer isn't registering the ipod properly
Mangu, I tried the mount command, once I found a terminal. as mount /dev/hda1 . and got the response can't find /dev/hda1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
Quartlow, is your partition an NTFS or a FAT one?
"sudo mount /dev/hda /mnt -o umask=777"
in the wiki it mentions something for hoary and i was thinking of trying it, is it a bad idea-- does anyone have any ideas?
sorry, /dev/hda1 instead of /dev/hda
Mang, the sudo mount line returned this,,, you must specify file system type
http://www.hilineeng.com/electrical_controls/food_processing/food_processing.jpg
that's unfortunate.  Even with the correction I made?
PsYchotic , i'm guessing fat since it has windows installed
hey i just installed something but i dont see it in my application where are the stuff i installed at with wine?
a newbie question here, what is the default root password for ubuntu live cd 5.10?
coz if it's fat, you need to mount it like this "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /media/whatever -o umask=777"
ok sorry Manugo, now I get no such file or directory
there is no root password
anyone know
Managu, ok thnx
how can i setup printers? whats the Gnome program to do it? i dont use Gnome so i need to know the progrma name..
~/.wine/c_drive/Program Files/
Managu, how can i use the root privilegde
or something similar
!root
Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
Managu, when i typed su it ask me to enter a password?
in terminal and there a way to add it to my start bar or something?
yup.  And since there's no root password, "su" will always fail.
in the 'expert' install you can set it up to have a root password (i did this time, on accident)
Managu, ok i get it now, i just type sudo -i
you would use sudo in stead, and if you REALLY want it you can do sudo passwd
Can someone help me with printing?
which isn't found?  /dev/hda1 or /mnt?
i'm in the same boat, i dont use Gnome and dont know the program to setup up printers :/
Managu, ok i get it now, i just type sudo -i
even better... what command did you decide on, exactly?
=== sub|at|alpopel is now known as sub|off
well, yes, that's an option.  Though spending all ones time as the root user is generally considered poor practice.
rinting (I believe)
im so confused
that would make sense if i used gnome, but i dont (which is hte issue)
does anyone have any usb device/ipod knowledge that they could share?
itrebal, oh I'm so sorry, I didn't read up
wine doesn't integrate incredibly well with the gui.  If that sort of integration is important, you might investigate commercial software like CrossoverOffice or Cedega
OK Mangu now I get  mount point media/hda1 does not exist
Can someone help me with printing?
ok but i just wana know how to open the program i just installed aka paltalk
what command did you decide on?  Could you type it here, letter by letter?
how do you add a disk permanently via the disks manager?
probably the easiest thing to do is (a) cd to it's installed directory, and (b) run its executable with "wine blah.exe".
nobody can help if they don't know whats wrong
ok it shows it installed
mugzie or possibly even using nautilus -- I think there's an association installed by default
are there no Gimp 2.3 packages in apt-get?
does any body here runs xgl?
what shows who installed, and how?
managu im so confused what ur saying lol im so new to this
this one,,,sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 -o umask=777
rinters
in the maine menu of winetools i hit installed programs and it shows the program
hell, i'll go into gnome :/
all i wanna know is how can i open it is there a shortcut or what
I'm probably not gonna be much help then, sorry.
Looking to install Ubuntu 5.10 on an old compaq PIII 500 with an odd notebook style CD-ROM CD-224E (Teac 24x).  Could someone advise what would be the best driver to use?  Generic is awful slow
