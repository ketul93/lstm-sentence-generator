hello, i need some help with ubuntu
i just installed it to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
sybariten: I'd have thought so; I don't use gnome
how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
!amarok
I guess amarok is a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/
amphi: neither would i... if i was sure i wouldnt lose stuff by changing
how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
sybariten: lose stuff?
Isn't the "thrash can" on the bootom right? next to the 4 desktop screen selectors.
!bash
For a list of basic commands, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands
!init
Init is how Ubuntu starts up misc. system services at boot time.  To control the services, please install the package "BUM" from "Universe" Repository
amphi: you know ... uh .. the terminal here in gnome has tabs, and it has choices to change char emulation instantly. could i do that under xfce, etc etc
loose stuff like that
!Aac
methinks aac is read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for information about aac support
night all! // jo ejt!
Yep. I was just about to mention that I_Love_DRM.
how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
sybariten: guess so; just use gnome-terminal I suppose; I use mrxvt for tabbed xterms
I_Love_DRM: you have a thrashcan there ?
i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
can anyone help me out?
I do too.  it looks like a calculator on my screen, but it's a trash can.
How do I correct 'dpkg-deb: subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)' ?
amphi: but i couldnt use gnome-terminal under antyhing but gnome could i
darwin188: you need to mess with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg I guess
hey folks, newcommer here
sybariten: why not?
I'm trying to install glibc
and then?
how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
hola
sybariten: AFAIK it's a standalone prog (albeit with a lot of shared lib deps probably)
alguien que sepa de linux que me ayude
"rpm -U webmin-1.260-1.noarch.rpm" - this command doesnt seem to work for me, any ideas of how to use a. rpm file?
Claudia, hablas ingles?
I need to install it
ompaul: yes i like the new edubuntu background too - although it's a kinda cold and is missing New Zealand (bug reported) :)
is there a way to lower my screen resolution, Ubuntu loaded tops and is hard on my eyes
no
!tell CLAUDIA about es
!es
Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
Old: ubuntu is debian not redhat
amphi: i thought gnome stuff required gnome as the window manager (althouih its prolly bigger than just a window manager today) to run, just as all K-programs (Kdevelop an all) would require KDE ... etc
bimberi, :-)
!rpm
methinks rpm is the Redhat Package Management file. Very similar to Debian's DEB files, but require alien to install. ask me about !alien
hola CLAUDIA
Old: ubuntu uses .debs not .rpms
ooh
hola nelisa
!alien
somebody said alien was a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
CLAUDIA: #ubuntu-es
Is there a way to use .rpms, like renaming it or something?
Amin: alien isnt really recommended to use
sybariten: you can run kde progs without kde (you still need the libs), same for gnome; I run gnome progs like gthumb here without gnome
Old: find a deb
Old, there's "alien", but you should look for a deb first
gracias
how do you add backports to dapper? like so i can get lame debs?
CLAUDIA: de nada
gnomefreak i cant tbh, this guide is old, and i bet the file isnt on google anymore
I'll look
Old: what is the app?
sabes espaol
aj_, there won't be any backports for Dapper yet - development of the next version hasnt' started yet
ok next question ...  if i compile something and then do make install in order to get it in place.... (in this case irssi) .. and i already had that tool installed via apt-get ... will make be able to "overwrite" my old version, and will the apt-system know that i got a new version of the irc client??

CLAUDIA: join #ubuntu-es

are there any good wiki pages for setting up software mixing of sound?
how to lower the res
I can't get my sdl games & teamspeak to play nice
so you can't get lame or mythtv in a repo?
gnomefreak, it's webmin, for administrating your counter-strike servers (game servers)
http://mirrors.redwoodvirtual.com/mirrors/www.webmin.com/download.html
aj_: did you enable universe and multiverse
yes
Can i use any of those?
!webmin
See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebminWithoutARootAccount for webmin instructions for Ubuntu. Webmin runs on https://localhost:10000 - As of Ubuntu 6.06, webmin is REMOVED from Ubuntu and will no longer be supported
how do i go about finding out about this 'mmsh://a814.l1977144512.c19771.g.lm.akamaistream.net/D/814/19771/v0001/reflector:44512?MSWMExt=.asf'.
sybariten: some of the integration stuff may not work (those DEs must be for _something_ ;), but the individual profs should work
dis, thats a windows media player link :p
thanks gnomefreak, i'll just take a peak

Yep. That's what it is Lurk3rX
hi all
i need help with vnc server, anyone up for that?
hey!!!
anyone have open-xchange working in a ubuntu box?
ok but when i installed easyubuntu last night the media played today it doesnt

nelisa, I'll look into the resolutions right now.
MENDIGO: #ubuntu-br
Sorry for the delay.
amphi: ok thanks man
thanks AlwaysIsey
MENDIGO, looks like you've gor a missing package

nelisa, how can i fix this?
capitalization error
MENDIGO: sudo apt-get update perhaps
MENDIGO, can you reach those pages in your browser?

mkdir /var/lib/apt/lists/br.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy-backports_universe_binary-i386_Packages would help?
hehe
Lmao
oops multiverse wan't enabled i thought it was but i did it by hand
AlwaysIcey, there's only a resolution there, that's way to high for my miopia
i can't get vnc server to work properly, again, anyone interested in helping me?
AlwaysIcey, how to get more res enabled?
MENDIGO: no
One more second nelisa, I'll look at mine.
coucho, I've dealed with VNC back in my win days
if I get a workable ress I would do better
nelisa: i'm still in those XD
AlwaysIcey, thanks
nelisa, Try clicking on the arrows next to the resolution.  Tell me if any more options are there.
this name is taken :(
AlwaysIcey, negative

anyone know why my mplayer always gives me the error "New_Face failed. Maybe the font path is wrong. Please supply the text font file (~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf)."
http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2006/5/21/4048 - bye bye Ballmer :)
How about the refresh rate, what options are there?
RandolphCarter: he's going somewhere?
mikebot: what does google say ?
amphi: gotham prison
AlwaysIcey, 60 Hx only
mikebot: did you install the mplayer-fonts package?
gnomefreak, read above. Could you help me perhaps?
sybariten, RandolphCarter not sure
nice job btw
AlwaysIcey, Resolution 1280x1024
nelisa: maybe you're able to help me out?
Old: that should be the path iirc
Is it an older computer nelisa?
RandolphCarter: ah, the purges begin ;)
gnomefreak, what's the exact path (Im new to ubuntu)
it's a laptop an HP Pavilion N5495
Old: i dont do much with perl except use it in scripts
nelisa, no, i was going to update to Dapper Drake but then when i saw that would have to download 500mb I choose to Cancel
hi olks
Old: /usr/bin/perl
RandolphCarter, how do i do that?
I just installed the 686 optimized kernel for Ubuntu, and now mplayer and xmms don't run. if I launch them from the command line, it just says "segmentation fault". I recompiled mplayer, but it still says the same error. any ideas? I tried googling, and maybe the nvidia X driver is related to this problem (I had a bit of a problem getting X to work with the nvidia driver when I installed the kernel, but it eventually worked)
hallo
cheers gnomefreak
mikebot: sudo aptitude install mplayer-fonts
RandolphCarter, thanks
I'm not sure then nelisa.  I haven't tried this on a laptop, so I'm not too sure how what resolution options you should have.
nelisa, I did a backup of the sources.list then i replace it with the backup and did a apt-get update
thanks, It's installing now gnomefreak.
hi , im on a live cd how can i partitionate my HDD
what software i need
Nintendud: you need to install the linux-686 package
ubuntu breezy live cd
RandolphCarter: I did
;p
AlwaysIcey, how do I poll my hardware for more res options?
hmm, so it can't be missing the nvidia kmod :(
whois guenni
oh wait
RandolphCarter: looks like I didn't. wtf o_O
join #ubuntu-laptop
i've got ubuntu running at 1280x800 on an acer 3023 with an ati card
I'll check this out, thanks
Qtparted
wooh
anyone here using irssi? please raise a hand
Nintendud: :P np's
and<
anyone here know a bit about raid? specifically raid0
RandolphCarter: would I have to restart? they still segmentation fault
Device Manager.
Nintendud: yup, you'd need to restart
ruchbah: can you see if you can do /set term_char ?
thought so
or at least, restart X
has anyone used automatix?
hmm, probably best to reboot
dell500: depends on what you wanna know
alright
brb
sybariten: yeah
there's some messages about loading restricted modules at startup :) gl
alright, thanks
if I'm not back, all is well
amphi: yes you run it or yes you can do /set blabla ?
hello all
need some help
termchar even
:(
coucho, well i have a raid0 array... i made the array with the onboard software (prog that came on the mobo) and i am using it in linux (kubuntu 5.10)
hello can anyone help me????????????
dell500: and what's the problem?
coucho, what I would like to do is get another large SATA and just back everything up on it, then use the 2 other sata's for OS's
sybariten: yes I use it ;)
!helpme
If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
sybariten: "Irssi: Unknown setting term_char" - what's that supposed to do?
I was just wondering if it's possible to get a new mobo that has more than 2 satas to hook it up so the transfer of 200gb of data to be copied will be faster
i want to configure dns server on the Ubuntu Machine can anyone teach me how can i do it??
dell500: if you've got a third drive, maybe raid4?
AlwaysIcey, what I'm looking for??
dell500: why wouldn't it be possible?
amphi: solve my problems  :)
amphi: according to the bitches in my regular swedish chan
sybariten: WAYTTD?
sybariten doesn't seem to do anything.  This is the first time I've used irssi.  Just trying it out
dell500: and sure, you can always get a PCI SATA-2 card and use linux's software mirroring too
coucho, i've only got 2 SATA ports for raid
anyone there?
amphi: what does that abbreviation mean ?
it's almost as fast, and you can just put the drives in another machine without it breaking horribly
nelisa, in Device Manager, you'll be looking for the Display Adapter or something similar to that.
dell500: i understand, but why would it not be possible for you to get a new mobo that supports raid on more than 2 sata ports?
ruchbah: ok thanks ... hmmm but did you get an error or not? try a termchar that doesnt exist, like /set term_char banana
what are you trying to do?"
RandolphCarter, my "vision" is to get all the data stored on one SATA drive, then enclose it, use it as USB, then use the RAID0 array (2 120 SATAs) to split up and use for OS
i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
coucho, i was wondering if it might destroy the raid array i have now and i would lose all my music and stuff... that wouldn't be good
varunvarde2007, http://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/en_GB/dns.html
can anyone help me out?
dell500: ah like that
thanks checking it out in a second
dell500: you won't be able to move the drives to a new mobo
dell500: super, mega, definitely not
ok
lol
has anyone had problems using automatix?  specifically firefox
and this is the problem with hardware RAID :)
amphi: ok, i'm trying to set IRSSI to get the character "emulation" (or whatever you call it) ISO-8859-1 ... aka "western"
sybariten .. nope.  No error.
(unless they're not in a RAID atm)
varunvarde2007, you will also need to read that howto at the bottom its far too much to do in irc
greg_: dont use it
ruchbah: ok, then it works for you ... dang
RandolphCarter and coucho, I guess I could just get an enclosure and copy via USB... but 200gb over usb scares me
dell500: i would advise you to get the disk, and get norton ghost or something to create an image and put that on your new hd
why not?
sybariten: no idea about that I'm afraid
!automatix
automatix is, like, totally, unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
^^^ greg_
this is giving me an anurisum
dell500: then just undo the array and reinstall everything
dell500: wouldn't be so bad, just leave it going overnight, probably take 3-4 hours?
is there a way to check my hard drive. to analyse it for bad sectors etc... it's an external hdd on fat32
coucho, u can do that?
greg_, if you use it, and you break your machine you will reinstall
anyone know how to make a .deb package of firefox 1.5 from source?
how can i know what ports i have open?
phace: badblocks
!ff1.5
You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
vlad: ^^^
gnomefreak, thanks
vlad: ywe
-e
yeah it did break my machine
dell500: of course, but everything that was on the array will be gone (or at least not accessible)
Does anyone know the reason why I get this message when I start Synaptic?

Rash, try netstat -an or netstat --help for options
i lost firefox
coucho, but that's pretty much a complete backup of it all? how safe is it?
leojstewart, because you don't have your CD in
AlwaysIcey, only video related thing is 82830 CGC
dell500: i don't think you have to worry about it, unless you get a crappy image maker
ghost's very safe, just do an integrity check afterwards
exactly
I'm not sure what to tell you then nelisa.  Have you tried in the #ubuntu-laptop room?
leojstewart, it should run fine anyway, though
is there a good one for ubuntu?
Of course the forums go down right before
one that doesn't crash? :)
I make a post.
Pyro: it does. Thank you. I was just wondering
dell500: most of those work outside an OS
dell500: ghost does anyway
I wasn't doing it before... I wonder why it is now.
ohhhh
gotcha
dell500: tar | bzip is farely safe and doesn't crash :)
AlwaysIcey, they sent me back to #ubuntu
*fairly
RandolphCarter, I've had some problems with tar'ing things
idk why
Nelisa, You need to find a way to make the equivalent of a conference call it would seem.
leojstewart, if you don't want to see that error, you can comment out the line from /etc/apt/sources.lst that checks the CD
dell500: i would get ghost, you can boot up and just copy your entire hd array to your new disk
But seriously, I hope you get help.
can i open terminals so they're already set to the folder i want them to be in?
Pyro: sorry, but I'm a linux-newbie.  Could you tell me exactly how to do this?
ghost only works with ext2/ext3 atm though (don't think it works with reiser)
dell500: i would probably allocate that disk first
The only other place I could recommend is maybe the accessibility chat room.  Otherwise, I'll leave it up to someone else here, since I haven't configured Devices manually or used a laptop with Ubuntu.
dell500: which fs do you use?
:(
didn't work
still segmentation faults
epositories
Nintendud: erk :/
Hey, I have a little question about getting new hardware working in an existing ubuntu breezy installation, I was hoping someone here could help?
then uncheck the "CD disk with Ubuntu..."
dbcalo , How do you define the ones you want them to be in? Do you want to pick them from nautilus or do you want the terminal to have a different default or something else?
!tell jlunder about ask
RandolphCarter: then again, I probably should have watched that apt-get more carefully; since it didn't have any dependencies to install, so I think everything in that respect was up to date
when i try and shut down ubuntu on my laptop it just goes blank screen and nothing happens, none of the diagnostic messages "shutting down root file system" or anything, just blank screen, never powers down either.  What do you guys think is wrong?
php5 and gd lib support, what do I have to do to ensure that  php is compiled with GD lib support/?

hi, how can i install LILO from a live cd , i just broke grub and ill install lilo to replace it
:(
anyone got any ideas of how to remove the other modules from webmin ?
man, I can't live without mplayer
http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/grub#restauration doing that doesnt work
eugman, i was hoping i could open them up with nautilus. i remember i used to be able to do such a thing but have since forgotten how to do so.
xmms I don't care much about, unless I want to spam music in IRC
Nintendud: heh
HellDragon: there are plenty of other GRUB tutorials/HOWTOs...
what's the disk info command again?
but still
:/
=== Sir_Squirrel is now known as McScruff
can anyone tell why im able to send in AMSN but im not able to send here in IRC
but i want to use lilo
not grub anymore
how do i make my newly installed ubuntu system to work...i keep getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
it always break
jlunder - what have you got?
every week it breaks
`RaSh: some channels require you to have a registered user name.
i will appreciate a lot the help
HellDragon: you boot every week??
Nintendud: hmm :/ not sure what I can recommend
RandolphCarter: :(
what's the disk info command again?
amphi, every day
its not here.
PyroMithrandir: worked perfectly. Thank you!
HellDragon: strewth
leojstewart, no problem :)
so, can anyone help me with my problem? after installing the 686 optimized kernel, mplayer and xmms only respond with a "segmentation fault" when I run them from the command line
dbcalo, Well I'm guessing you could do something with nautilus scripts and the cd command. Or copy the folder and then open a terminal and type cd and then paste the location into it but that's no fun.
darwin188,  sounds like you need to reconfigure your X server properly. perhaps install the nvidia or ati drivers. depending on your video card.
i dont know what to do now
i can only boot on a live cd
Nintendud: they don't even give you any other output? :/
Right, so I just put a new CD burner in this machine. It shows up in "Computer" but as a regular CD-ROM, and I can't burn anything through the nautilus interface. Is there some magic I need to invoke to get things working?
RandolphCarter: nope
but i dont even have a graphical interface
what's the disk info command again?
nintendud@johnspc:~$ mplayer
Segmentation fault
BAM
ok thanks everyone
same with xmms
maybe  iw ill come tomorrow for help
thakns
how do i reconfigure the the xserver?
bye all
which is why I was so confused
;p
!reconfigure
I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Dr_Willis
hello, i'm having a problem...
Nintendud: you could try running it under gdb and see if that gives you any idea
what's the disk info command again?
!fixres
Help to fix the display resolution is available at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
gdb?
how can i manage the services of the system?
I've never heard of that
lol, I was just thinking that
it's the GNU Debugger
coucho: what disk info command? df ?
eugman, i'll keep looking into. i know last time i used linux there was a drop down menu it was in if you were looking at the contents a folder.
amphi: finally, thanks
i keep getting "error while loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0" whenever i run quake4 or, im assuming, any other program thats uses SDL.  I have it installed and linked in ld.so.conf and it still does it?
how do i create a user with the permission like a root user? (ex i want the user: warlock to have full rights like a root user does)
nelisa: I may have a workaround for you, although it's not a solution.
RandolphCarter: alright, I ran gdb, now what do I do? ;p
Old, may I ask why?
Nintendud: run mplayer under gdb, and when it crashes, do bt to get a stack trace, and see if you see anything enlightening
!tell Old about root
Nintendud: are you using proprietary nvidia X drivers, BTW? ;)
Nintendud: you need to run 'gdb mplayer'
Old, your first user - the one you created during install - has full sudo privs - you can give any subsequently created users the same
eugman, im installing webmin, and it needs a account to start my gameservers, i dont want to use the root account
i want to give multiple user read/write access to a dir. ive created a symlink to this dir in each of their home dirs. each user belongs to the same group as the dir. and the perms on the dir were set with 'chmod 1660 dir_name'. why doesnt this work?
then type 'run' and wait for a crash
amphi: if you mean if I'm using "nvidia" instead of "nv", then yes
I only created 'root' there :-(
(press return too)
helldragon .. I've had problems with grub which I solved by booting a live cd then going into the /bin (? /usr/bin ?) of the hd install and running grub-install from there.  There was more to it than that, but that was the gist.  Does that sound like something to explore for your situation?
Old, no it does not - this is ubuntu
Old, read the webmin page on the Ubuntu wiki
sorry, i'm trying to manage the services of ubuntu, how can i do that?
I need nvidia for dual screens
Nintendud: you can do 'file /usr/bin/mplayer' at the gdb prompt, and then 'run'
ompaul, huh?
Old, read the web page that ubotu sent you as a message
Assistive Technology Support, you can enable the magnifier and a few other options.  If nothing else, that will help until you get a solution.
Old: you do not want a web program to have root priviliges, webmin == evil
disabling root account, I dont want that..
oh
but..
Perkin,  could read up on how the SysV init system works.. if thats what you are refering to.. theres also gui front ends to manage what gets started when.
amphi: did it, but uh... weird output o_O
what user should i use then?!
Old, no buts read the web page
Nintendud: that might be what's breaking mplayer and xmms - someone had a similar problem yesterday; you could check if using the nv driver makes the problem go away
k, let me read it
amphi: I need dual monitors though!
:(
and, I believe nvidia is necessary for that, right? :P
Old: what's wrong with teh good old command line to start services?
I had no problem with the 386 kernel and nvidia
Nintendud: *shrug* - trying with nv would at least show if that was the cause of the proble,
it's just this one
:/
hello. can anybody help me getting my network / internet working?
er, problem
alright, I'll try it
hold on, editing xorg config
!commands
is there anyone in here who can help me with vnc server?
from memory, commands is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands or http://www.linuxcommand.org/
Dr_Willis: i saw that i can manage the main services, like schedules, with something called gnome-services or similar. do you know that?
Knorrie, im new to ubuntu, mind explaining a little more ?
or should I show you gdb's output first, amphi ?
I always use the root account, I dont dare to disable it
maike-maus: you're on irc without a network connection? :P
Perkin,  im old skool and normally twiddle the rc.d links myself.
?
Old: that is not very wise
how do i make my newly installed ubuntu system to work...i keep getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
amphi: um, gdb says: Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
Old, In ubuntu root isn't used. Sudo is used before root level commands.

Let me read it ompaul
again.
darwin188: did you look through the manual yet?
bofh isn't really swearing :/
i dont have a manual
amphi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14418
i jsut have a cd
tpektoerjtre9j
amphi: that contains the error messages from run too
Old, read that web page again, running as root is bad, it opens you to attacks in individual clients and gives too much power to applications that should not be trusted
AlwaysIcey, upping the fonts helped loads
Glad to hear that nelisa :D
question 2, whay are there black borders on the screen?
amphi: it says glXChannelRectSyncSGIX ;p
Nintendud: yeah, looks like the same problem - $SMALL_SUM says switching to the nv xorg driver will make this problem go away
Alright ompaul, Like im said. Im new to ubuntu and im trying to run applications as easy as possible, and as smoothly as possible. I'm not much of a googler to look for ways to get around not-using root.
darwin188: help.ubuntu.com / wiki.ubuntu.com
I'm not sure about that at all.  Maybe someone else can answer it.
amphi: but, how will I use dual monitors?
i already tried that not a lot of help
I don't think there is a way to do that under nv
refers to this channel
ok, i'll see in another way
Old: what gameservers are you running.. just curious :)
Nintendud: no idea - perhaps reinstalling the nvidia driver will fix it, dunno; it'd be worth checking that the problem goes away with the nv driver, as I grow weary of saying
alright, I'll check that first
I'll be back
Knorrie, counter-strike servers, I work for alot of companies, and communitys. I know the basic in ubuntu to run game-servers, but im interested im learning more so i can do more with my game-servers.
Old, that page says use sudo, if you want to install something it asks you for your password that is all, no one can brute force your root account that way, I could stay here all night doing one liners, take it as read it is a bad idea, or research it on ww.securityfocus.com
well, brute forcing my password is impossible.
darwin188: k wait a second
Old: sorry to ask, but why do you complain about a sarcastic sysadmin story, and run games where people shoot each other, i dont get it
Old, if the machine is compromised through the game server you will have only yourself to blame for running it as root, and personally I think you should go and do some research to understand what is wrong with running applicaitons as root
thanks
games where people talk and help each other are too much  like IRC :P
Dr_Willis: heh
hi people, what is more secure way to set up an subversion server? Inetd or an script that initialize it on booting time?
i want to give multiple user read/write access to a dir. ive created a symlink to this dir in each of their home dirs. each user belongs to the same group as the dir. and the perms on the dir were set with 'chmod 1660 dir_name'. why doesnt this work?
Dr_Willis, can we quote you on that?
what _is_ a subversion server ?
ompaul,  :P sure.. im allready on tht bash.org site a few times
dgl: i use subversion and apache2 with the subversion-module
Knorrie, I'm sorry to answer your questiong and you wasting my time litterly when im busy trying to sort out webmin. I have a son playing this game, And this is what i litterly do for a living. If you feel that what I'm doing is wrong, can you please me a work, as i cant seem to find any. Didn't really do good in school.

lumpster: ok ...
Old: no offence
Dont.. please
RandolphCarter and coucho, thanks for the help... btw, if you have a USB hd, you can ghost the image over to the usb from the raid0 array, right?
hm, nothing for a guy who hasnt learned to use cvs yet i guess
Knorrie, man, i will use lighttpd and I know that there is a way to do something like it with lighttpd
dell500: that should be the case
sybariten, a software server for moving data and keeping things in sync
dell500: as long as it's been allocated
dell500: you're welcome btw
Im not having an attitude, but I'm really having it tough finding a work, And i get paid for this. As long as i get paid i do whatever it takes so get money so i can make a living.
ompaul: that much i know
k... is there any other ghost image creators out there besides norton?
dell500: aye, good luck
thanks :)
Old, it's literally...
dell500: nope, ghost's proprietary
Old: your blood pressure... ;)
dell500: I'm not sure how easy it'd be to ghost onto a USB drive
dell500: what he said
hmm... i'll find it somewhere
ompaul: just got the impression that subversion was the "new and fancier" type of CVS, and hence nothing i should look into
grub show me a smiley now...

sybariten, CVS on steroids if you need more :)
- Sorry, just tired and kinda getting mad at this webmin, as I cant seem to get it to work, I'll brb a second, need to read the page ompaul gave me.
Does anyone know how the install-time hardware detection in Breezy works? Or where I could find out more about it?

anyone willing to help with an alsa / AC'97 prob

hardware is probably https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport

no go
dell500: i think the latest is 8 or something, but i'm not completely sure
coucho: hmm, okay, but afaik it relies on the DOS drivers, and I'm yet to see a DOS USB-HDD driver
Knorrie, I will not have people mentioning plesk in this channel I am trying to recover :-)
Hey everyone.  I'm very new to Ubuntu, and just now got it installed on my computer.  I installed it on a 250GB hard drive.  I gave 10GB to /root 20GB to /home and 1GB to /swap (i know thats a lot).  I ran into problems when trying to format the remaining 219 GB as FAT32, so I just left it as free space.  Now I want to format it so that I can share files between Linux and Windows.  What's the best way to create this partition?
2005 is 9.0, so i think 2006 is 10.
Knorrie: aye, what's so bad about ssh?
can anyone help me :(
ompaul, I created a user, and gave it a password. Is that all?
RandolphCarter: ssh isn't bad, did i say that?
=== subsinker is now known as sub|at|alpopel
jonuk: 219GB is way to big for fat32
jonuk: cfdisk is pretty easy
nope, kinda agreeing and diss'ing webmin for being pointless
!comfort ompaul
I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Knorrie
Old, that is all there is too it, if you need to run a command in a terminal, sudo command and it asks for your password
RandolphCarter: true, but i believe that it works after the usb driver has been loaded
:((((((((((((((
Or should i disable the root usage aswell, If so. Is this user account i created -safe- to use for my gameservers and my webserver, so i can administrate them?
+p isn't the limit for fat around 137 gb?
coucho: yeah, it should
I have two cdrom drives installed, where can I find what they're known as?
HellDragon: you're a dragon from hell, you shouldn't :(((((((
ompaul, so when i login with putty i will be using my new account i created instead of root in the future?
jonuk wheres your /? /lib /etc ????
RandolphCarter/dell500: i would have to check be sure though
Briguy: cat /etc/fstab
Briguy: ide?
darwin188: try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
ty
There's a -bunch- of hours and work on this server, I wouldn't feel too good if i messed it up by disabling the root account.
ruchbah, sorry i don't konw what you're talking about
root@0[k# grub-install
install_device not specified.
so I can use CDISK to make partitions?
Old: you can always fix it by chrooting in from a livecd
any thoughts on running ubuntu on a T43p Thinkpad?
dgl: i'm running a dedicated apache2 install somewhere to server subversion repo's, just because the svn people made a apache-module like http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/libapache2-svn
im on a livecd
jonuk: cfdisk, yes
spacey:  what's the standard size for a FAT32 partition?
Ah, I know. But i have a few things todo on my spare time, and i dont feel like going down to the server just to fix that :-)
jonuk: maximum size you mean? i don't know, google it:)
Old, if you gave root a password and installed software and let it run as root all bets are off its reinstall time sorry but that is how I view it
jonuk: 1.44 MB ;)
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
maximmum size, yes
HellDragon, what?
jonuk: the max FAT32 partition size is 2TiB
AlwaysIcey, bunch of unknown devices in dev manager, where to look at first?
ack
you say a 250gb drive, w/ 10gb for /root, 20gb for home and 1gb for swap, with the rest unformated, where's the rest of your instalation?  Whaeres your root partition?  Is this up and running?
how the hell can i reinstall grub
grub-install doesnt work
looking at this deal for a durable high res ubuntu box... http://tinyurl.com/o2lym
can somebody help me with a library location problem im having
HellDragon: let me try to help you
HellDragon: you didn't specify the device
http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/grub#restauration i tried that , didnt work
ompaul, but cant i like..remove the root account, or perhaps disable it from people accessing it?
i see a smiley when i boot
no menu with kernel list and windows
buzzed: man, that's pricey, my PowerBook was less than that
2 terabytes?  why didn't a 219gb partition work then
amphi : how can i specify it
I just installed 3ddesktop - how do i run it?
jonuk: where you formatting it in Windows?
HellDragon, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/grub gives a few pages that you can try I am off to bed in two minutes
*were
HellDragon: what partition is your ubuntu install /
?
HellDragon: you're on a live cd, can you mount your ubuntu partition somewhere under /mnt ?
i can format it in either linux or windows
is your PB UXGA?
i dont know amphi
Knorrie, i dont know im lost
HellDragon: dont panic
hello
HellDragon: pastebin the output of 'fdisk -l /dev/hda'
how can you dont panic with all the spam
ook
well, windows won't like formatting a large drive, but mkdosfs /dev/*drive**partition* should work
HellDragon: spam?
nothing
fdisk -l /dev/hda says nothing
oh, sudo mkdosfs..
well, how about this
Old, the page tells you how to, however if a program is running as root one of these game servers your talking about then *all bets are off* the risk of a compromise is too high
Old, and with that I am gone, good night.
Knorrie HellDragon -- I've done that for a similar thing.  Had ubuntu on hd and booted dsl.  Mounted.  Ran grub-install.
RandolphCarter: PB 15 in. UXGA?
buzzed: 12", for Uni lectures ^_^
HellDragon: sata hd?
Oh well, Is there a high risc of people hacking theirselfs into my system?
I'll make a 20GB FAT32 partition, to let me read/write files in either linux or windows.  Then I'll make the rest just NTFS, so I can at least read the files in Linux
RandolphCarter: he'll need -F 32 to get anything larger than 2GB or so
amphi: yes
hyphenated: it'll automagic that
HellDragon: now you say so...
Old: not even people, there are lots of automated botnets that try to do that all the time
ack, no it won't, you need -F 32 :( (my bad)
HellDragon: fdisk -l /dev/sda perhaps
wrar, anyone using ubuntu on a ppc here, preferably a powerbook? If so, does switching virtual terminals with ctrl-alt-fwhatnot work?
2sec
bung I think there's a channel #ubuntu-ppc
bung: it worked in debian on an ibook, FWIW, but it was alt-ctrl-some_meta_key_fn
ruchbah: thanks
okay, running with nv
and uh, still a segmentation fault
http://pastebin.ca/57783 amphi
:(
Nintendud: no segfaulting?
HellDragon: *snarf*
no, there's segfaulting
dell500: not that i encourage software piracy *wink wink* but if i were you i'd get hiren's boot cd, which is downloadable via bittorrent
same problem :(
Knorrie, Hmmm.. But if i change the root password to something extremly hard then?
amphi: it works on the livecd iirc
bleh
so, now I have no clue what to do
:(
=== Hglcobra is now known as chriswk
i'll be in ubunti-ppc, this is too busy
Old: you shouldn't allow remote password-based-logins for the root account
HellDragon: ok; do this; 'mkdir mnt'
"E: Sub-process usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)" -- my friend keeps getting this error for gnome-terminal-data
What's up?
ok amphi
Old: never ever ever
is there bit torrent on this?
HellDragon: and then 'mount /dev/sda7 mnt'
jesus christ it's thundering loudly outside
ok
nintendud im guessing u like nintendo lol
woah - wait a second. Could someone take that again? Should i change the root pass to something hard (I'll write it down) to prevent brute forcing(?)
Nintendud: well, it would appear not to be your nvidia driver, so you can have your monitors back ;)
mugzie: yes, but that's irrelevant to my problem
amphi: yeah, but.. now what?
why
HellDragon: ls mnt shows you files and directories ?
yes
HellDragon: that's 'ls mnt'
is there bittorrent on ubuntu?
coucho, what version? 8?
mugzie: xmms and mplayer error out with a segmentation fault right when i run them. this happened after I installed the optimized 686 kernel.
HellDragon: ok; try 'chroot mnt'
mugzie: yes, Azureus is good
burps
o ok
mnt is empty now
so, does anyone have any other suggestions?
I really want to get mplayer back :(
Peolple, what is more secure way to set up an svn server? Inetd or standalone process?
HellDragon: pastebin me the output of 'mount'
Nintendud: don't use the sloptimised kernel ;)
Should i change the root pass to something hard (I'll write it down) to prevent brute forcing(?)
amphi: aww. :(
http://pastebin.ca/57786 amphi.
alright I'll uninstall it and reboot
brb
dell500: i believe the newest hiren's boot cd is 7.5, but i could very well be wrong
anyway i can get a 3dfx card working?
coucho, i'll look it up
what does hiren's boot cd do?
negman: as i said, i don't encourage software piracy :P, but it has a number of very useful programs on it
HellDragon: /dev/sda8 ??
coucho - what are the useful programs?  i've not even heard of it.
negman: harware testing tools, partitioning tools, backup tools, things like that
huh amphi ^
gotcha
anyone know where i can find a 32bit libSDL-1.2.so.0 file?
can i have some help?
i dont have any sda8
negman: it's great, it'll really simplify any of that stuff if you have to do it
HellDragon: your fdisk output shows /dev/sda7 as the linux partition, sda8 as linux swap; mount output shows "/dev/sda8 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)"
How might I go about installing SDL on Ubuntu 5.10?
coucho, 8.1 is out, but it has norton ghost on it too :) neat cd
can i burn a uso on ubuntu
dell500: yeah huh XD
iso**
HellDragon: look at what you just pastebin'd
mugzie theres plentty of ways to do that
dell500: i love it, i take it everywhere with me :P
o ok
cause im downloading something
download k3b
MorbidHunger, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
thats weird amphy
anyone seen elephants dream?

i wanna go see brokeback mountain
coucho,  nice lol, ultra geek... i'll bbl, gotta get some lunch meat before the deli closes, peace
dell500: later dude
HellDragon: it is indeed; still, wtf, damn the torpedos, eh? ;) try 'grub-install /dev/sda'
Does anybody know where i can find a 32bit libSDL-1.2.so.0 file?
invalid device: error 94

hi, how would Ubuntu react if I have a dialup modem and the Call Waiting service from my phone provider ? would it disconnect me automatically?
wtf
Another question
HellDragon: start again ;) and ask someone who has a sata disk ;)
i feel like a dick
what does that mean
HellDragon: what kind of mobo do you have?
thanx
touch yourself and die
I got the webmin to work atleast, lesser work then I though. And I actually remember everything I just did, that's a good sign of success *laughs* :-)
HellDragon: say what now?
but when i put the other video card in the it keeps saying the x server isnt installed
I'm having problems with install libstdc++5, sudo apt-get install libstdc++5, and I get a problem saying that with in my achives folder permission is denied
that gives me an idea
i dont know what to do amphi
eme?
I have use Wireless Internet, so when I was installing Ubuntu, it couldn't recognize my network settings (since I couldn't plug in).  I know how to go to Network Settings and get my Wireless connection active (obviously), but everytime I reboot I have to reactivate it.  How do I get it to permanently connect each time I boot?
The file /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly.
 wtf is taht
MorbidHunger, you need to run that each time you swap video cards
HellDragon: what kind of mobo do you have?
E: Could not get lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
E: Unable to lock the download directory
HellDragon: means grub didn't install; reboot the cd
ill forget all the command
breeden: you have some other package manager open?
breeden, do you have Synaptic or something open too?
ill need to do everything over amphi ^
alright
but the one im using now is onbored
i have an s3trio i want to use
ok i reboot
brb
HellDragon: for now rembember your ubuntu / fs is /dev/sda7 - or is sda8? ;)
well, this is a fresh install of ubuntu, and I'm really not a linux user.  But ubuntu's default application add hasn't been of any help
I haven't tried synaptic yet
I don't think its install though
ok, I think I see the problem
thanks
I have a 64bit system but quake4 needs 32 bit libsdl files... where can i get those?
ynaptic
hey whats that program to adjust the brightness of xv
I had synaptic already open, hopefully this should fix the problem
it worked, thanks alot :)
breeden: that's why the package managers use the lock, so they don't clobber each other ;)
maike-maus: knoppix? That's bad news...
Hi, I really need to LAN card working on my laptop, but it doesn't tell me the model name. Is there a tool for this?.. Thanks a lot.
im back amphi

hi soundray
lss: what kind of laptop?
but wtf with the smiley ^
grub is laughing at me ^

soundray: network / internet doesn't want to work :(
lss: you may find info at linux-laptop.net and/or tuxmobil.org
lss: i think you've got it right there
coucho,  thanks, amphi  thanks too
lss: yw
AAAAAAAAAAAH lets scream up and down
maike-maus: same problem as ~20 hours ago?
dgl, to my understanding xinetd is not backwards compatible with inetd...  It would require some manual tunning if you were planning on running a server that didn't support xinetd directly, I believe
HellDragon: 'when in doubt, run in circles, scream & shout' ;)
lol
grub is dead!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAH!
breeden, ok, so u should use openbsd-inetd?
rofl
HellDragon: how did you trash your mbr?
soundray: yes, xserver working but network still down
dgl, if you aren't planning on running any servers or anything like that you probably wont notice the difference, I would go with inetd
openbsd's
maike-maus: does the net work when you boot a live CD?
amphi : with partition magic on windows
i tried to resize J
its a NTFS part
soundray: ubuntu live cds doesn't boot... I tried with kanotix, this works great...

yes
and would it conflict with my onbored video?

everything worked fine before that damned 686 optimized kernel
Nintendud: don't complain @ ubuntu if you compile yourself ;)
Knorrie: xmms doesn't work either
and that wasn't compiled by me
a smoking ati rage lt pro onbored video
:P
Nintendud: I meant is it dodgy - it might be worth trying memtest86
Briguy: use nano man, much better
amphi: no.
:P
I seriously doubt it's a RAM issue
Nintendud: me too, just fumbling for a straw ;)
Briguy: ESC :wq
like I said, it worked when I booted into the 386 kernel, but once I uninstalled the 686 kernel and rebooted... segmentation fault again
if i reconfigure the x server does it have to be running
I've added a Samba share to my desktop so i can copy files to and from it. Why don't those network connections work when i use the 'browse'  function on websites in Firefox?
Nintendud: but that it worked with the 386 kernel while the 686 one was installed, but not when the 686 was uninstalled makes no sense at all
amphi: I know.
MorbidHunger: probably not, maybe it even needs to not run
i ran it while it was running
Nintendud: so don't muddy the waters ;)
but when i put the s3trio in the server bitches at me and wont run
is it cuz i have onbored video?
amphi: it might make more sense if I told you that everytime I booted into a different kernel, X would crash on boot and I had to apt-get install and remove nvidia-glx-dev before it would run, and it would continue to work correctly every time I rebooted until I use a different kernel
er, apt-get remove and install*
MorbidHunger: a server? video? does a server need a video card?
dont think so
but it wont run
whichj puzzles me
(might have to do with "nvidia TLS links", since whenever I install it it updates the "nvidia TLS links"
)
any idea why hibernate stopped working in Dapper, it just restarts the system now.
arr, this is weird
Nintendud: that's part of the fun of proprietary drivers I believe; just pick a kernel and stick to it, is my advice ;)
what's a s3trio? or is that a really dumb question?
DewDude: hibernate sounds like suspend to disk... and yeah.. network connections will be lost
amphi: well, I still don't know how to fix this. and it's really frustrating me.
i'm not talking network connections
this video card i found laying around at school
i know they get lost
coucho: some video card chip
lol k
coucho: an antique ;)
heheh
i'm taking about rather than restoring after syuspend, it just restarts
i just cant get it to work with ubuntu
it is very old
cuz i pretty much stopped all my apps that use networking before i hit hibernate
Nintendud: pick a kernel, and reinstall all the nvidia packages I'd guess
my athlon xp died and im stuck on this peece of shit from hell
hmm
MorbidHunger: why wont the onboard card work?
MorbidHunger: i would suggest buying a geforce 4 or something, costs nothing and will work
well, I'm only using the 386 kernel now
it does work jsut horrible
i dont have an agp slot on this mobo
...oh..wait...would suspend to disk be dependant on the kernal image you were using?
hello does anyone know a good APACHE-MYSQL-PHP for ubuntu?
MorbidHunger, you need to run the reconfigure command after putting in the new card (sorry if you have, I was awy for a sec)
MorbidHunger: i've got a mx420 and it works perfectly, and it probably exists as pci card too
DewDude: this is using swsusp?
MorbidHunger: if it's meant to be a server... an utp cable is more important than vga :P
umm...i'm hitting hibernate from the log off menu
it's worked before
heh
meh
Knorrie: you dutch btw?
coucho: yes
ah
ubuntu doesnt even detect my onbored audio
m2
i dont have a fan or a heatsink either
however, when i was using the wifi earlier, i was using my 386  kernal rather than the 686 because my wifi tends to lock the 686 kernel up
coucho: i saw you using paste.ubuntunl ;p
XD
DewDude: it might be that you need to boot with restore=/dev/foo where /dev/foo is your swap partition, for it to work
um hello
Evanescent: hi
its amazing this thing works
MorbidHunger: lol
i should send ug uys pics later
heh, well, if it's using disk swap, it's probablty already overwritten the session
MorbidHunger: lol @ onbored audio
yeah
:D
this is where i make myself look really stupid
ill see if i can get a sound card tomroww
DewDude: er, s/restore/resume
MorbidHunger, that's a shame because ubuntu worked on all my hardware
Evanescent: you're not stupid
MorbidHunger: you do that
only thing i can't get running is 3d on my laptop
its cuz im on a compaq and my karma sucks
DewDude: and yes, a normal boot will obliterate the session
!MorbidHunger++
can someone tell me how to install ubuntu as a dual boot with 2kpro?
Morbid fact: On June 29, 1955, the reign of King Haakon VII, who had ruled Norway from the time of its independence in 1905, effectively came to an end when the beloved monarch fell in the royal bathtub at his palace in Oslo. The elderly king lingered on for over two years before succumbing on Setpember 21, 1957, to complications resulting from his fall.
amphi: alrighty then, no real big loss
this is horrible guys
it had worked before..i'll ahve to play with it a bit
HOLY CRAP
Evanescent: first install 2k, then install ubuntu
amphi: reinstalling nvidia stuff and everything worked
dominion: whiskey tango foxtrot?
I don't even have to reboot
my laptop lacks battery, so, if i take it anywhere, i like to sysuspend to disk so i don't have to wait for the boot process
Does anybody else have problems with Gmail-Notify?
DewDude: yeah, I use swsusp a lot
wish application could you recommend me for partitioning my disk????
thank you amphi. makes me wonder if I could reinstall the 686 kernel and reinstall nvidia things to get it to work. ;p but I am not doing that today
ok but will the s3trio conflict with the onbored video?
Evanescent: the ubuntu installer will overwrite the boot record with a boot-loader, and present w2k and ubuntu choice
thanks for the help and patience
DewDude: no need to reboot, evar ;)
cocox: partition magic
whats the command to display system information
coucho, for linux ?
coucho: no
XD
just kidding
sry
amphi: yeah, i think my problem was i didn't specify the kernel i suspended with, because i think my ndiswrapper conflicts with 686
Can anyone help me please? I have this error message after.....

cocoxparted or cfdisk or ...
coucho, ( WinROFLING face... )
Evanescent: whenever 'repairing' w2k or reinstalling w2k, the windows installer breaks your system
Knorrie: yeah i've already got 2kpro installed i'm just not sure how to go about installing ubuntu. i downloaded the iso, opened it with undisker and burnt the files to a data disc but it's not bootable
Khoacalacan. thats the same shit i got
heh
Dam anyone know how to fix it???
hey, i've like, installed linux, then installed XP, then fixed dual boot
man, i had some fun with the MBR that day
install xp than linux
DewDude: yeah, it's not rocket surgery ;)
Evanescent: when you burn the iso to a cdrom it should be bootable
Khoacalacan, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=174537 read this at the end
Ok thank you
amphi, dual-booting or my suspend issue
Khoacalacan, there is the solution
DewDude: that's not very wise
DewDude: dual booting
i should read that roo
too*
Thank you cocox
coucho: i know. I learned my lesson when after resoring my MBR, my XP partition was gone.
Khoacalacan np :)
DewDude: ouch XD
i was able to get that back by telling CFDisk to repartition
hooray for crappy hardware!!
coucho: no, cfdisk fixed it in about 2 seconds
it's been dual-booting ever since
DewDude: I imagine very Bad Things(TM) will happen if you boot a different kernel than you suspended with and manage to get the session to restore
DewDude: wow
amphi, yeah, i totally forgot i had done that.
Knorrie: even after opening the iso file first?
DewDude: didn't think that was possible
cuz i was about ready to throw this out a window earlier
coucho: sure it is.
Evanescent: you dont need to open an iso, just burn it byte-by-byte to a cdrom
i had a drive partition completely disappear once
Cocox: Is it near the bottom of the topic or the whole thing?
DewDude: doesn't the xp install completely overwrite the mbr?
hey i am making a multimedia cd for windows and i want to make an icon for the launcher to launch    does anyone know how to do this?
amphi, what is the difference between qparted, cfdisk or gparted ??? can anybody please tell me wish one is the best ??
hello all, just wondering if there is a way to test surround sound in ubuntu?
coucho: yes, it does
but..if you partition your drives out
DewDude: then what?
back up the MBR, install windows, then restore the MBR, that CAN work
Evanescent: you're burning in windows?
provided you don't backup before setting your partitions
Knorrie: ok i'll try it but if it desn't work i'll be back to haunt you...
yes
Evanescent: using what tool?
cocox: depends for what - one of the parteds if you need to resize some existing partition, otherwise cfdisk for just normally partitioning a disk; there's fdisk and sfdisk as well, but cfdisk is the simplest to use
nero
DewDude: so first install linux, backup mbr, install xp, replace mbr?
coucho: that's one way of doing it IF you want to install linux before windows
Evanescent: nero should allow you to just 'burn cd image'
but make sure you have EVERYTHING partitioned out
coucho: or just reinstall grub
yeah
amphi, all those allow me to change mi partiotion size without erase my data ??
DewDude: yeah i just installed xp first, seemed easier XD
you'll need a live or bootcd either way
Evanescent: i did that some long time ago when i had windows installed :P
yeah it's being awkward
Cocox: Is solution near the bottom of the topic or the whole thing?
my nfs mount stopped working.  I didn't change anything, but now I get the message "mount: box:/media/jakarta failed, reason given by server: Permission denied" .. there's nothing in the server or client /var/log/messages and the exports allows 192.168.* ... any suggestions of where I could look now?
im so screwed
Khoacalacan, lol just the last post
ok i'll try it anyway, thanks for now
MorbidHunger: get some decent hardware
oh I was reading the whole thing XD
MorbidHunger: sorry :P
coucho: the parteds are for that as I said; I've succesfully resized an ntfs partition once for someone with a parted; better to back up before messing with partitions generally, IMHO
Falstius, did you check your /etc/fstab?
i need to buy a mobo
i dont have 60 bucks
Khoacalacan, excuse me the one before the last post
MorbidHunger: student life is hard
yeah
or...wait..is the NFTS drive in your local machine or are you doing it over LAN using Samba?
espically when im busy fixing everyone else stuff
and than they bitch about the free work i did
Arghhhh
DewDude: I can't mount it from the command line either ...
meh sorry for the rant
MorbidHunger: just buy asrock or something, that oughtta be less than 60 bucks
ttyl guys
later
mom finished dinner
MorbidHunger: have fun cu later
yeah im sure i cna buy one for less
but not one id be happy with
Falstius: answer my question about the location of the NTFS drive
true
ttyl guys
thanx for the help
MorbidHunger: my current server is a PII233
233?
im on a 450 k6-2

MorbidHunger: so quit yer bitching ;)
mine is a p4 2.4, i know, overkill XD
MorbidHunger: so DONT COMPLAIN :DDD
im not bitched about the cpu
ghehehe
DewDude: a simple mount "box:/media /media" gives me that error.  This is NFS, not NTFS.
just the video
MorbidHunger: serial console rocks
MorbidHunger: it can't do 80x25 console?
oh, nfs

where do you put .sh files?
like, i got samba commands memorized
Anyone know where to put my .sh files?
ahh, I'm the opposite.  Normally I can just do nfs, but I have to look up anything to do with samba.

Knorrie: how's that?
hmm i don't know
one second, dont say anything, I think i found the problem. (Getting late :-(
Knorrie: oh wait, command line interface right?
Old: dunno about webmin, but you might want to specify the absolute path to stop.sh
Knorrie: so don't do that then ;)
can someone tell me how to play MIDIs on ubuntu

Should I use kernel framebuffer device interface?
Knorrie: and since i don't have a monitor for my servertje i was planning on using vnc for some stuff
so about my shutdown question? any ideas?
at the very least is there a shutdown LOG so i can see if anythign is happening?
figured out my NFS problem, 192.168.* style wildcards aren't working.  Maybe its the VPN running.
hi
this is the stop script amphi, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14421
darwin188 - do you have a file called /etc/XF86config, or some variation on that?
where?
Old: why don't you just make a proper init script for it?
i d like to know if someone knows a way to revert a "rm" command ?
how do you mean ?
darwin188 - sorry /etc/X11/XF86config
Knorrie: is there some sort of xthingy viewer for windows?
is there a kind of trash when we use rm ?
Old: like the ones in /etc/init.d
tommy_: no undelete on ext3
how do i check taht?
darwin188 - do this .. cd /
Looks like the same amphi ?
tommy_: no trash
amphi, well, to bad for me
darwin188 -  .. cd /etc/X11
coucho: #ubuntu-nl?
yow
darwin188 -  then ls
command not found
tommy_: yeah ;(
darwin188 -  sorry the dots weren't part of it.  Did you type those?
I get this error amphi, Output from command .. /tmp/.webmin/529328_2_run.cgi: line 2: cd: /home/cs/warservers/speedlink: Permission denied /tmp/.webmin/529328_2_run.cgi: line 2: ./stop.sh: No such file or directory
ok lets see
the ./stop.sh command works in that dir
no such file or directory, hey but i installed the powerpc version
/home/cs/warservers/speedlink <- that dir, the stop.sh works
Old: in what dir?
darwin188 -  you'r on a ppc
yes
darwin188 -  you're on a ppc?
My system often freezes when I exit Azureus
Old: but that's probably not webmin's CWD
does anyone know why?
huh?

thats what i get when i try to ./start.sh

Why is WEBMIN no in the ubuntu repos?
not*
yes i am on a ppc
darwin188 -  you out there?
How do I get tar to extract to a certain directory?
jadaz87, it is
yes i am

lufis: man tar ;)
jadaz87, it's in Universe
amphi, ;)
ping ruchbah_
Madpilot: i have both universe and multiverse enabled
lufis: I commend -C to your attention ;)
amphi, any ideas why i get that error? I cant seem to understand it
darwin188 -  ok, there is a ppc channel #ubuntu-ppc (I think)
okey
Ampi: alright, thank you
jadaz87, you running Breezy or Dapper?
but it shouldnt be different
amphi&
i think
Madpilot: dapper
believe
jadaz87, I read somewhere that webmin has been dropped completely from Dapper
NOO!!! :-(
Madpilot: why?
Old: the error is clear - no script called stop.sh in CWD
Madpilot: can i install the one from breezy?
Hi, does any body knows how to change the totem video output? i install xgl, the videos are really slow, I think I have to change it to gl or gl2...
CWD?
'cat /etc/X11/FX86' but hit tab before enter and let it auto compleate
Old: current working directory
ruchbah_, there is no channel #ubuntu-ppc
darwin188 -  what do you get?
jadaz87, no idea, on either of your questions
Why is it that with the 'Weather Report' that when I click Update, it seems to update, but the 'Last Update' says a time of twenty or so minutes ago?
hmpfh
Old: because the cd command failed
from your paste above
Does anyone know?
leojstewart, the weather only updates once an hour or so - it's from the US Weather Service website
anyone could tell me how to force framebuffer to use a i810 driver instead of the vesa one?
Madpilot - any where else he should check for ppc specific stuff?
Oh, I thought it was from Weather.com
thanks, Madpilot
gonna try something else, one sec
ruchbah_, no - but there are Ubuntu_PPC users here...
ok
is there any way to make it update from a different website which updates more fequently?
shinu: console fb?
Madpilot, I;m trying to plug my ipaq
leojstewart, it's an open source app, so probably ;)
darwin188 -- you still out there?

keithsr: you do smbpasswd zizou
yes
keithsr: is this samba?  if so samba has its own password list - "sudo smbpasswd -a username"

nope
someone told me to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but i dont know what to do there
what do i install to get j++ support?
adrums20: Odd.
hi
amphi you still there ^
thats what I thought.  I have been reading all day on the posts and nothing works after a fresh install
when using smbpasswd it gives all options when  i use the options it says it had to abort
grub works, but i cant boot on linux, only windows, when i try to boot on any linux kernel it says error 17 : sda8 not mounted
adrums20: I'm not quite sure what that means.  You could do "sudo grep 'root' /etc/shadow"
darwin188 -- is the linux box on line then?
mount /dev/sda8 doesnt work
adrums20: The second field is a crypted password.
no its offline
anyone can help me
linux is recently installed and unconfigured to do anything
anyone have any hint for me ? =- what do i install to get j++
adrums20: It should be a bunch of jibberish (don't post it here), but it might be a "*".
adrums20: A "*" indicates no password set.
but i get to errors
Helldragon i can try
darwin188 -- what happens when you try that dpkg command?
Helldragon: because sda8 is your swap partition, IIRC from your fdisk -l output - what is the kernel command line in grub?
once I do that command, it goes back to the prompt
=== sub|at|alpopel is now known as sub|off
i get into a blue screen
with options
for selecting drivers, resolutions, keyboards etc
i dont understand amphi
=== sub|off is now known as sub|at|alpopel
but everythging seems to be selected just fine
when i do startx
darwin188 -- ok, that's good.  Get there
adrums20: Wait, you did "sudo grep 'root' /etc/shadow" and got no output?
i get error of Unable to find a vlaid framebuffer device
okey
Helldragon: linux is trying to mount the wrong partition as / AFAICS
thats correct - nothing
thats weird
how can i fix that
For those of you who know your way around linux, how long did it take for you to get down the basics?
 fdisk -l output says nothing
im using bash
adrums20: Ok...  Well, do "sudo less /etc/shadow"
darwin188 -- do you have an option in there to not look for a framebuffer dev?
where do i setup enviroment variables ?
nothing goes back to the prompt again
That should allow you to view the contents of the /etc/shadow file (which contains your crypted passwords).
someone told me to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but i dont know i guess

Helldragon: in the grub menu, choose linux, hit e, go to the kernel line, and if it says root=/dev/sda8 try changing it to /dev/sda7

darwin188 -- fine
anyone else unable to use google search?
adrums20: Hmm...I have to go.  Hopefully someone more knowledgable than me can help.  What you're saying should NOT result from a normal install, though, so either you're doing something simple wrong (that I'm just missing) or something was VERY messed up with your install.
now i am on configuring xserver-xorg..select the x.org server modules that should be loaded by default
PORDO, works for me
PORDO: google works from here

adrums20: i usually just do 'sudo -i'
adrums20,  can't you just use sudo -s from your normal user instead of logging in with root ?
